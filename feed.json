            "summary": "<p>Welcome to our latest recap of what's going on in the indie game space. A bunch of new games dropped this week that are more than worthy of your attention, including a modern take on an old-school Ninja Gaiden side-scroller and a joyful (perhaps even profound) puzzler about the life of a housefly.</p>\n<p>By far the biggest story in indie games over the last few weeks concerns payment processors pressuring the likes of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/itchio-is-removing-nsfw-games-to-comply-with-payment-processors-rules-133045491.html\">Steam</a> owner Valve and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/itchio-is-removing-nsfw-games-to-comply-with-payment-processors-rules-133045491.html\">Itch</a> to remove or de-index games that feature adult, NSFW and LGBTQIA+ themes. Under the guise of helping to protect women and children, an conservative activist group in Australia has taken credit for the delistings, as well as stricter rules regarding adult-themed games that Steam and Itch have implemented. But some affected developers <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/visa-and-mastercard-pressuring-itch-io-and-valve-does-nothing-to-protect-women-and-shock-games-will-just-be-side-stepping-the-ban-entirely-say-affected-indie-devs/\">suggest</a> this is a smokescreen to push forward an agenda of anti-LGBTQIA+ censorship.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>This week, Engadget senior editor Jess Conditt spoke with solo developer Cara Cadaver of Final Girl Games about <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/vile-exhumed-is-an-unjust-casualty-in-steams-sweeping-censorship-campaign-170203493.html\">the impact of the censorship campaign</a>. Valve permanently banned Cadaver's new game, <em>VILE: Exhumed</em>, from Steam for allegedly depicting &quot;sexual content with depictions of real people,&quot; though the developer says that assessment is inaccurate. While Cadaver and publisher DreadXP are working on alternative distribution for <em>VILE: Exhumed</em>, Steam is <em>the </em>go-to marketplace for many PC gamers and the ban cuts off what surely would have been a critical source of revenue for the game.</p>\n<p>For its part, Itch has <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/itchio-starts-reindexing-free-nsfw-content-152431716.html\">started reindexing free adult-themed games</a> on its platform. The company has relied on Stripe and Paypal for processing payments. It has suspended payments via Stripe for 18+ content and it's talking to other potential payment partners &quot;that are more willing to work with this kind of content.&quot; In any case, payment processors should not be the arbiters of morality, and they certainly should not be helping activists restrict access to perfectly above-board works of art.</p>\n<p>One other piece of news that caught my eye this week is about a game jam that's taking place this month. Participants will have just over three weeks to make games based on real-life investigative reporting. According to <a href=\"https://globalgamejam.org/news/partner-jam-investigative-journalism-game-jam-floodlight-gaming\">Global Game Jam</a>, the teams will gain access to exclusive reporting on organized crime and corruption from around the world and be able to ask journalists behind those stories questions about their work. It's a fascinating idea, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what the developers that get involved come up with.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-new-releases\">New releases</h2>\n<div id=\"19171c3ca6f94314ac42a0b65b4d3039\"></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-is-a-love-letter-to-the-series-nes-roots-150050773.html\"><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em></a> is what I like to call a \u201chell yeah&quot; game. There are few purer joys than getting about 15-20 minutes into a new game and thinking \u201chell yeah, this rules.\u201d Even better, that feeling lasted through the other four hours or so I spent with <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>.</p>\n<p>This is a throwback 2D hack-and-slash platformer from The Game Kitchen \u2014 the studio behind the Blasphemous series \u2014 and publisher Dotemu, which is building quite the reputation for itself as a purveyor of retro-style games (<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</em>, the upcoming <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>). <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound </em>looks and sounds sumptuous, with gorgeous pixel art and stellar level, character and audio design. It\u2019s got combat that's somehow both sticky and slick, and it\u2019s challenging without being too frustrating.</p>\n<p>I've had a tremendous time with this one, which, if memory serves me correct, is the first Ninja Gaiden game I\u2019ve played. I can\u2019t really find any notable faults with <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>. It\u2019s well worth checking out. It\u2019s out now on Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.</p>\n<div id=\"185b58e8e49943a8811d342967d70e6d\"></div>\n<p>Here\u2019s another \u201chell yeah&quot; game. I\u2019ve been looking forward to <em>Time Flies</em> ever since I clapped eyes on it during a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/time-flies-hands-on-summer-game-fest-day-devs-140056653.html\">Day of the Devs showcase a couple of years ago</a>. You play as a fly and the goal is to check off a bucket list of items before the insect perishes (their lifespan equates to the average life expectancy of a country of your choosing but in seconds).</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a clever, funny and slightly rude \u2014 in a playful, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/thank-goodness-youre-here-is-a-vibrant-funny-unashamedly-silly-game-133030648.html\"><em>Thank Goodness You\u2019re Here</em></a> sort of way \u2014 blend of exploration and puzzle game that makes a strong case as to why we should make the most of our limited time. It\u2019s a short game, as it took me about 90 minutes to roll credits. That's pretty much the ideal length for this one.</p>\n<p>The controls are simple (only a D-pad, pause button and a way to call up the bucket list are required) and the aesthetic, which features hand-drawn art, is delightfully low-key too. In fact, this would be a perfect fit for the Playdate, which just happens to come from Panic, the publisher of <em>Time Flies</em>. For now, though, you can check out this lovely little game from the team at Playables on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2000120/Time_Flies/\">Steam</a>, PS5 and Nintendo Switch.</p>\n<div id=\"09685648830342cfa48b4ce6a493143d\"></div>\n<p>Whatnot Games released the 1.0 version <em>Star Racer</em> on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2626120/Star_Racer/\">Steam</a> this week after over a year of early access. This is a retro racer very much in the vein of the F-Zero series that features local multiplayer (here's hoping for online multiplayer at some point) and music from Grant Kirkhope of <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> and <em>GoldenEye 007</em> fame. You can also create your own tracks and share them with others online.</p>\n<p>I love the launch trailer for <em>Star Racer</em>, which blends gameplay with '80s-style animation. I also adore that \u2014 per <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-racer-a-combat-ship-speedfest-about-evading-the-fuzz-as-an-alien-mom-has-zoomed-out-of-early-access\"><em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>\u2014 one of the characters is a &quot;detective-looking fella called Thrash Whiplash.&quot; If that's not in the running for the best video game character name of the 2020s, we're all going to need to take a long, hard look in the mirror.</p>\n<div id=\"c52be5dee7b24643b516e5b8249b85a6\"></div>\n<p>We have yet another flavor of pretty, retro-tinged pixel art this week thanks to developers Ancient Corporation and Bitwave Games, as well as publisher Limited Run Games. Their 16 bit-style shoot-'em-up <em>Earthion </em>landed on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3597580/Earthion/\">Steam</a> this week.</p>\n<p>It features music from legendary composer Yuzo Koshiro (<em>Streets of Rage, ActRaiser, Shenmue</em> and many more games). That probably should not come as a huge shock given that he co-founded Ancient.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Earthion </em>is also slated to hit consoles starting in September. Being a Limited Run title, physical editions are of course on the way for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X and Nintendo Switch. Expect those later this year. A physical version is also expected for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive in 2026.</p>\n<div id=\"4a28c6c7786d4336986dcadf2e1af76e\"></div>\n<p>Surgent Studios went in a completely different direction for its follow-up to its well-received Metroidvania from last year, <em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>. Its latest project (released with the help of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/palworld-developer-pocketpair-has-opened-up-a-publishing-division-194713511.html\">publishing arm</a> of <em>Palworld</em> creator Pocketpair), <em>Dead Take</em>, is a first-person psychological horror about an actor who is looking for a friend who has vanished after a Hollywood party.</p>\n<p>There's top-tier videogame acting talent here, with Neil Newbon (Astarion in <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>) and Ben Starr (Clive Rosfield in <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>) taking on the lead roles, and a litany of other well-known performers \u2014 from Laura Bailey to Sam Lake \u2014 also making appearances. That cast alone makes this worthy of attention. <em>Dead Take</em> is out now on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352690/Dead_Take/\">Steam</a> and the <a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dead-take-532460\">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"95ed39c2fa00445a9769a249c9861f38\"></div>\n<p>It feels like we've been waiting forever for Hobbit life sim <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tales-of-the-shire-is-a-cozy-village-sim-where-you-cant-run-but-you-can-skip-130027018.html\"><em>Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings</em></a><em> Game </em>to drop and, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cozy-lord-of-the-rings-game-tales-of-the-shire-is-delayed-to-july-213500109.html\">following some delays</a>, it's now available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016460/Tales_of_the_Shire_A_The_Lord_of_The_Rings_Game/\">Steam</a>. (This is now technically an indie game because Take-Two sold off publisher Private Division last year.)</p>\n<div id=\"ac26ecd3823145579a74771bf01c7967\"></div>\n<p>I love games that tell you exactly what they're about in their title and <em>A Game About Digging A Hole</em> sure is one of those. You dig a hole, find buried goodies, and sell them to help you buy better gear.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Developer DoubleBee and publishers Rokaplay and Headup brought this exploration game to <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3fbfa9f5-23c1-4837-98a0-81bc41be3466&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=iOS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9hLWdhbWUtYWJvdXQtZGlnZ2luZy1hLWhvbGUvaWQ2NzQ0NjA4NjAzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzZmJmYTlmNS0yM2MxLTQ4MzctOThhMC04MWJjNDFiZTM0NjYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBwcy5hcHBsZS5jb20vdXMvYXBwL2EtZ2FtZS1hYm91dC1kaWdnaW5nLWEtaG9sZS9pZDY3NDQ2MDg2MDMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAX0z7YHfSXbJjMBmx8YwLZPaLUj6sddq5AVGAmlPhOpW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fa-game-about-digging-a-hole%2Fid6744608603\">iOS</a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3fbfa9f5-23c1-4837-98a0-81bc41be3466&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Android&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Y29tLmhlYWR1cGdhbWVzLmFnYWRhaCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiM2ZiZmE5ZjUtMjNjMS00ODM3LTk4YTAtODFiYzQxYmUzNDY2Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Y29tLmhlYWR1cGdhbWVzLmFnYWRhaCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVFhtReh5-oUdC0ufdh4jAwcCikanxWAj1z7VIhzD2oi&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.headupgames.agadah\">Android</a> this week after a hugely successful debut on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244220/A_Game_About_Digging_A_Hole/\">Steam</a> earlier this year. <em>A Game About Digging A Hole</em> has now sold more than 1 million copies.</p>\n<div id=\"737d0440c3ae430b83c4e61d7e51721c\"></div>\n<p>Perhaps you're looking for a different digging game to check out this weekend. In that case, <em>Mashina </em>may be worth considering. The titular character is a robot that searches for valuable minerals to help repair and expand her community. Mashina can also use the minerals to build machines that can help with her digs, while she can use items she stumbles upon for base decoration.</p>\n<p>Developers Jack King-Spooner and Talha Kaya (who previously released <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1960900/Judero/\"><em>Judero</em></a>) used traditional stop-motion techniques to animate <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3395930/Mashina/\"><em>Mashina</em></a>. This charming-looking puzzle/exploration game is now available on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3395930/Mashina/\">Steam</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"54e1cd899ba540a7a4b6734d1cfd5bcb\"></div>\n<p>Let's wrap up this section with a short, experimental game about anxiety. <em>A Dream About Parking Lots</em> has been out on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3500340/A_Dream_About_Parking_Lots/\">Steam</a> for a few months and the aptly named Interactive Dreams (with the help of Take It Studio!) brought it to PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch this week. It's said to be based on real dreams and will see you looking for your car among parking lots and mazes while chatting with a therapist.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-upcoming\">Upcoming</h2>\n<div id=\"c0ec4e4e013f43a5b0a5c935e175c8ad\"></div>\n<p><em>Wander Stars</em> \u2014 from Paper Castle Games and publisher Fellow Traveller \u2014 was supposed to be arriving this week, but the developers have pushed the release date back until September 19. The team wants to carry out some changes to improve the game following feedback from an open beta.</p>\n<p>I really like the look of this one, and though turn-based combat isn't usually my cup of tea, I'm very intrigued by the system that's in use here. You'll find and combine words into phrases that convert into devastating attacks. There are more than 200 words and they have cooldowns, so combining them in smart ways will be a key to success. Using words &quot;with honor&quot; can seemingly help you unlock more useful phrases too. Very curious to see how all of that works in practice. We'll get a better idea next month, when <em>Wander Stars</em> lands on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1575810/Wander_Stars/\">PC</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"849f437eb92647f98d01f16f817b2a90\"></div>\n<p>Speaking of games with a killer look, a gameplay trailer for <em>I Hate This Place</em> hooked me in this week. This is an isometric survival horror game that pulls from the visual stylings of its comic book origins. Crafting is vital here, both in terms of your arsenal and strengthening your shelter before nightfall. This stylish title from Rock Square Thunder and publisher Broken Mirror Games is bound for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch later this year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-terrific-2d-ninja-gaiden-housefly-bucket-lists-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110005806.html?src=rss",

            "summary": "<p>A jury in Florida has found Tesla partially liable for a 2019 crash involving the company's Autopilot self-driving feature, <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/08/01/tesla-found-partially-liable-fatal-2019-crash-involving-driver-assistance-technology-jury-orders-200-million-damages/?location=alert\"><em>The Washington Post </em>reports</a>. As a result, the company will have to pay $43 million in compensatory damages and even more in punitive damages.</p>\n<p>Autopilot comes pre-installed on Tesla's cars and handles things like collision detection and emergency braking. Tesla has mostly avoided taking responsibility for crashes involving cars with the Autopilot<em>&nbsp;</em>enabled, but the Florida case played out differently. The jury ultimately decided that the self-driving tech enabled driver George McGee to take his eyes off the road and hit a couple, Naibel Benavides Leon and Dillon Angulo, ultimately killing one and severely injuring the other.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>During the case, Tesla's lawyers argued that McGee's decision to take his eyes off the road to reach for his phone was the cause of the crash, and that Autopilot shouldn't be considered. The plaintiffs, Angulo and Benevides Leon's family, argued that the way Tesla and Elon Musk talked about the feature ultimately created the illusion that Autopilot was safer than it really was. &quot;My concept was that it would assist me should I have a failure \u2026 or should I make a mistake,&quot; McGee said on the stand. &quot;And in that case I feel like it failed me.&quot; The jury ultimately assigned two-thirds of the responsibility to McGee and a third to Tesla, <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tesla-autopilot-crash-trial-verdict-partly-liable-rcna222344\">according to <em>NBC News</em></a>.</p>\n<p>When reached for comment, Tesla said it would appeal the decision and gave the following statement:&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Today\u2019s verdict is wrong and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla\u2019s and the entire industry\u2019s efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology. We plan to appeal given the substantial errors of law and irregularities at trial. Even though this jury found that the driver was overwhelmingly responsible for this tragic accident in 2019, the evidence has always shown that this driver was solely at fault because he was speeding, with his foot on the accelerator \u2013 which overrode Autopilot \u2013 as he rummaged for his dropped phone without his eyes on the road. To be clear, no car in 2019, and none today, would have prevented this crash. This was never about Autopilot; it was a fiction concocted by plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers blaming the car when the driver \u2013 from day one \u2013 admitted and accepted responsibility.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nhtsa-concludes-tesla-autopilot-investigation-after-linking-the-system-to-14-deaths-161941746.html\">investigation of Autopilot</a> from 2024, crashes were blamed on driver misuse of Tesla's system and not the system itself. The NHTSA also found that Autopilot was overly permissive and &quot;did not adequately ensure that drivers maintained their attention on the driving task,&quot; which lines up with the 2019 Florida crash.</p>\n<p>While Autopilot is only one component of Tesla's larger collection of self-driving driving features, selling the idea that the company's cars could safely driving on their own is a key part of its future. Elon Musk <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1727484899374899687\">has claimed</a> that Full Self-Driving (FSD), the paid upgrade to Autopilot, is &quot;safer than human driving.&quot; <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/teslas-first-robotaxi-rides-kick-off-in-austin-texas-100015076.html\">Tesla's Robotaxi service</a> relies on FSD being able to function with no or minimal supervision, something that produced <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/teslas-first-robotaxi-rides-are-already-running-into-a-few-bumps-205308245.html\">mixed results</a> in the first few days the service was available.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 1, 6:05PM ET: </strong>This story was updated after publication to include Tesla's statement.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-found-partially-liable-for-a-deadly-2019-crash-193612682.html?src=rss",

GOG believes the website takes a stand &quot;against the quiet erasure of creative works from digital shelves,&quot; a response of sorts to recent decisions from Steam and Itch to delist certain violent and sexuality-explicit games from their respective platforms.</p>\n<p>GOG is currently offering 13 games for free for the next 48 hours, some with well-known scandals and others that seem to fall into the &quot;NSFW visual novel&quot; bucket that makes up the majority of sexually-explicit games on digital storefronts. The titles available to download are:</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><ul>\n<li><p><em>Leap of Love</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>Being a DIK \u2014 Season 1</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>Leap of Faith</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>POSTAL 2</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>House Party</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>HuniePop</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>Lust Theory</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>Agony + Agony Unrated</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>Treasure of Nadia</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>Summer's Gone \u2014 Season 1</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>Fetish Locator Week One</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>Helping the Hotties</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>Sapphire Safari</em></p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>POSTAL 2, a </em>graphically violent open-world game, is a notable inclusion because it was <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/news301104postal2nz\">banned in New Zealand</a> in 2004 and <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.neowin.net/news/27-games-get-pulled-from-steam-in-germany-likely-for-being-controversial/\">delisted from the German version of Steam</a> in 2016. <em>HuniePop, </em>one of several &quot;adult-only&quot; games Twitch streamers are <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/list-of-prohibited-games?language=en_US\">explicitly forbidden to stream</a>, makes sense on the list, too. GOG has made a concerted effort to preserve games of all types, including <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gog-lays-out-the-business-case-for-robust-game-preservation\">maintaining them</a> so that they run on current hardware. The point of making these games available to download is as much about preservation as it is about highlighting how apparently easy it is to pressure digital storefronts to remove content, though.</p>\n<p>Valve's decision to delist titles from Steam was chalked up to <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-now-bans-games-that-violate-the-rules-and-standards-of-payment-processors-and-banks-164222173.html\">a new rule</a> that requires games to abide by the standards set by the payment processors that work with Steam.

If you haven't heard yet, a slew of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-all-the-latest-features-for-iphones-new-operating-system-including-facetime-updates-135749454.html\">new exciting updates</a> are coming to Apple's operating system this fall. No, it won't be called iOS 19 \u2014 it'll be named iOS 26. The change we're most excited for is the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html\">new Liquid Glass design</a> (<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-liquid-glass-is-windows-vista-done-well-181954910.html\">think Windows Vista</a>, but arguably more thoughtful), which looks to be Apple's largest visual update in years. We spent two weeks test-driving it \u2014 you can check out our detailed <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html\">hands-on iOS 26 preview</a>, or you can try it out yourself by <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-install-the-ios-26-public-beta-171117199.html\">downloading and installing the public beta</a>, available now. (While the beta is open to the public and stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Not ready to upgrade your smartphone this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your phone will be able to run iOS 26.</p>\n<p>Last year, Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list, but that's not the case for 2025 \u2014 a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind.

If you haven't heard yet, a slew of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-all-the-latest-features-for-iphones-new-operating-system-including-facetime-updates-135749454.html\">new exciting updates</a> are coming to Apple's operating system this fall. No, it won't be called iOS 19 \u2014 it'll be named iOS 26. The change we're most excited for is the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html\">new Liquid Glass design</a> (<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-liquid-glass-is-windows-vista-done-well-181954910.html\">think Windows Vista</a>, but arguably more thoughtful), which looks to be Apple's largest visual update in years. We spent two weeks test-driving it \u2014 you can check out our detailed <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html\">hands-on iOS 26 preview</a>, or you can try it out yourself by <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-install-the-ios-26-public-beta-171117199.html\">downloading and installing the public beta</a>, available now. (While the beta is open to the public and stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Not ready to upgrade your smartphone this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your phone will be able to run iOS 26.</p>\n<p>Last year, Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list, but that's not the case for 2025 \u2014 a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall.</p>\n<p>We'll get to the bottom of which iPhones will support iOS 26 this year.

And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-26-will-bring-apples-new-liquid-glass-ui-to-your-desktop-174149070.html\">the new macOS Tahoe 26</a> on your desktop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-are-the-new-and-notable-features-of-ios-26\">What are the new and notable features of iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:</p>\n<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages:</strong> iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Polls in group chats:</strong> Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.</p>\n<p><strong>Filtering unknown senders in Messages:</strong> If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual Intelligence:</strong> Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.</p>\n<p><strong>Photos tabs are back:</strong> For anyone who's still frustrated with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-apple-redesigned-its-photos-app-around-customization-120038901.html\">Photos changes made last year</a>, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.</p>\n<p><strong>FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: </strong>A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature</a> that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"New Hold Assist being displayed at the wwdc keynote\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/a506ddc0-4556-11f0-9d7a-9a93e6a181c1\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>Apple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes.

It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages:</strong> iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Polls in group chats:</strong> Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.</p>\n<p><strong>Filtering unknown senders in Messages:</strong> If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual Intelligence:</strong> Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.</p>\n<p><strong>Photos tabs are back:</strong> For anyone who's still frustrated with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-apple-redesigned-its-photos-app-around-customization-120038901.html\">Photos changes made last year</a>, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.</p>\n<p><strong>FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: </strong>A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature</a> that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"New Hold Assist being displayed at the wwdc keynote\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/a506ddc0-4556-11f0-9d7a-9a93e6a181c1\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>Apple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes.

Chromebooks and ChromeOS devices are widely used in schools around the world, so it made sense that Microsoft would want to offer something competitive. Windows 11 SE, and the Surface Laptop SE that launched alongside it, were the company's latest attempt to do just that.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Clearly the plan didn't work, as evidenced by Microsoft's decision to shutdown Windows 11 SE just five years later. The operating system was available on other low-cost devices, but it doesn't appear that it acquired nearly the same-sized audience as ChromeOS. If it had, Microsoft likely wouldn't be dumping it so unceremoniously.</p>\n<p>Windows 11 SE isn't the first time Microsoft has tried to spin-off a more efficient version of Windows, though it did seem like the most thought out. For example, the company has also tried <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-03-windows-10-s-store-bing-edge-default.html\">Windows 10 S</a> (which lives on as &quot;S Mode&quot; in Windows 11) and the never-launched <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-02-microsoft-windows-10x-dual-screen-pcs-surface-ne0.html\">Windows 10X</a>, a streamlined version of Windows for dual-screen devices.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While Windows 11 SE devices will work after Microsoft's October 2026 cut-off, the company recommends &quot;transitioning to a device that supports another edition of Windows 11 to ensure continued support and security.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsoft-is-killing-its-failed-chromeos-competitor-windows-11-se-200050553.html?src=rss",

The indexed chats didn't explicitly include identifying information. But in some cases, their contents reportedly contained specific details that could point to the source.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>To be clear, this wasn't a hack or leak. It was tied to a box users could tick when creating a shareable URL directing to a chat. In the pop-up for creating a public link, the option to &quot;Make this chat discoverable&quot; appeared. The more direct explanation (&quot;allows it to be shown in web searches&quot;) appeared in a smaller, grayer font below. Users had to tick that box to make the chat indexed.</p>\n<p>You may wonder why people creating a public link to a chat would have a problem with its contents being public. But <em>Fast Company</em> noted that people could have made the URLs to share in messaging apps or as an easy way to revisit the chats later. Regardless, the public discoverability option is gone now.</p>\n<p>In <em>Fast Company</em>'s report, Stuckey defended the feature's labeling as &quot;sufficiently clear.&quot; But after the outcry grew, OpenAI relented. &quot;Ultimately, we think this feature introduced too many opportunities for folks to accidentally share things they didn't intend to, so we're removing the option,&quot; Stuckey announced on Thursday.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-removing-chatgpt-conversations-from-google-194735704.html?src=rss",

            "summary": "<p>Reddit is reversing course on its plans to put some subreddits behind a paywall, at least for now. CEO Steve Huffman said the company is &quot;shifting resources away&quot; from the effort as it doubles down <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-should-be-a-go-to-search-engine-steve-huffman-says-230039621.html\"><ins>on search</ins></a>.</p>\n<p>During the company's recent earnings call, Huffman said that Reddit was &quot;deprioritizing&quot; its work on &quot;user economy&quot; initiatives in order to put more resources into turning the site into a &quot;go-to search engine.&quot; In a follow-up AMA on Reddit, he confirmed this includes pausing work on paid subreddits.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>&quot;To stay focused on what matters most, we\u2019re shifting resources away from a few areas, such as work on the user economy,&quot; he <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RDDT/comments/1mec0sa/comment/n698gt7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\"><ins>wrote</ins></a>. &quot;This includes what some have referred to as paid subreddits.&quot; Though Huffman added that &quot;it's still an opportunity we believe in,&quot; it's a notable departure from comments he made <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-ceo-says-paid-subreddits-are-coming-this-year-203823936.html\"><ins>in February</ins></a>, when he said such features would be rolling out in 2025.</p>\n<p>Reddit's priorities have apparently changed considerably since then. While paid communities were meant to appeal to Reddit power users, the company still very much needs to grow its user base, according to Huffman. &quot;The folks previously working on user economy will join our efforts to improve the core app, including onboarding and personalization,&quot; the CEO explained in another AMA <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RDDT/comments/1mec0sa/comment/n698uqf/\"><ins>response</ins></a>. &quot;That gets at our most important need today, which is logged-in core user growth.&quot;</p>\n<p>While Huffman has spent the last year <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-ceo-teases-ai-search-features-and-paid-subreddits-225636988.html\"><ins>hinting</ins></a> at paid features, it's not hard to understand why Reddit would now be shifting away from that model. Advertising is still very much the most important part of the company's business, as Huffman <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RDDT/comments/1mec0sa/comment/n69dnkf/\"><ins>explained</ins></a>. And adding more core users to the platform will be key to growing that business. To put this in perspective, during the last quarter, Reddit <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://investor.redditinc.com/news-events/news-releases/news-details/2025/Reddit-Announces-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx\"><ins>pulled in</ins></a> $465 million in ad revenue and just $35 million from &quot;other&quot; sources, like data licensing and Reddit premium. Even if paywalled subreddits could substantially increase that &quot;other&quot; number, it would still be a small fraction of what the company is making from advertisers.</p>\n<p>So while paid subreddits may still be on the company's roadmap, users shouldn't expect to see them any time soon. They can, however, probably expect to see more ads in more places on Reddit over time. For example, Huffman said that the company <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RDDT/comments/1mec0sa/comment/n69c77k/\"><ins>sees</ins></a> &quot;ads on search return pages \u2026 as a future opportunity.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-puts-its-plans-for-paid-subreddits-on-hold-181455933.html?src=rss",

If that pans out, the Switch 2 would easily outsell the original Switch, which took a full year to hit that same 15 million sales number \u2014 making it a rare bright spot in today's gaming world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Despite those superb sales figures, Nintendo says demand is outstripping supply in many regions and promises to boost production as soon as possible. There's some insight into Nintendo's available inventory elsewhere in the earnings report. The 5.82 million number counts sales up to June 30, and the company says that as of July 25, it had sold through \"more than 6 million\" consoles. That's not the clearest figure, but it definitely shows sales cratered in July despite consistent demand.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>Switch 2 software sales were also strong with 8.67 million units sold, thanks in large part to the company's Switch 2 <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle along with <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>and games from outside publishers (Nintendo also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/a-nintendo-direct-focused-on-third-party-games-is-taking-place-on-july-31-133158933.html\">just announced</a> a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/persona-3-reload-arrives-on-switch-2-in-october-134501067.html\">bunch</a> of new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/chillin-by-the-fire-is-a-relaxing-co-op-campfire-sim-thats-out-today-on-nintendo-switch-2-150009762.html\">third-party games</a> coming soon). The company also sold 24.4 million games designed for the original Switch, largely because the new console is backwards compatible with previous Switch titles, it said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>All of that meant that Nintendo had a very good quarter, more than doubling revenue over last year to 572.3 billion yen ($3.8 billion) with a 56.9 billion yen profit ($378 million). The company still expects to bring in 1.9 trillion yen ($12.6 billion) for its fiscal year.&nbsp;</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><strong>Update, July 1, 12PM ET: </strong>This story has been updated after publish. The headline and article initially mistated the period in which Nintendo sold 5.82 million Switch 2 consoles as 7 weeks. That period relates to Nintendo's claim of \"more than 6 million\" sales, rather than the 5.82 million figure. The headline and article now accurately reflect the sales figures, and we regret the error.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-has-sold-over-6-million-switch-2s-but-still-cant-keep-up-with-demand-120011674.html?src=rss",

            "summary": "<p>Nothing did things differently with its third generation of phones. First came the midrange <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review-rising-above-the-boring-competition-120014496.html\">Nothing Phone 3a</a> (<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review-rising-above-the-boring-competition-120014496.html\">and 3a Pro</a>), which combined stylish hardware with a competitive price. Now, the company has launched the <a href=\"https://intl.nothing.tech/products/phone-3?Colour=White&amp;Capacity=12%2B256GB\">Nothing Phone 3</a>, which it's calling its first \"<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3-hands-on-dot-matrix-glyph-flagship-phone-173019742.html\">true flagship</a>.\" At $799, it's Nothing's most expensive phone yet, featuring a bigger screen, four 50-megapixel cameras and a major redesign of the company\u2019s signature Glyph interface, which has evolved into the more compact Glyph Matrix.</p> \n<p>Nothing's hardware design is what truly sets its phones apart from the established players, and the 2025 model is more elaborate and complex than ever. At this price, however, it faces stiff competition from entry-level flagships like the Galaxy S25 and iPhone 16. Beyond the innovations and occasional gimmicks, has Nothing nailed the fundamentals enough to compete?</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-hardware-and-design\">Hardware and design</h2> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Nothing Phone 3 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/25945170-6e33-11f0-b5e7-469b3b6bbb69\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>Once again, Nothing has made a phone that commands attention like no other. Everywhere I go, people are curious when they see me using the Phone 3, and the Glyph Matrix seems to both confuse and delight them.</p> \n<p>Unlike the protruding camera unit on the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, the Phone 3\u2019s three cameras are separately lodged in the back and jut out a fraction of a millimeter. The see-through exterior returns, displaying screws and hardware modules organized into three vertical rows. This time, it\u2019s more apparent that this is a design flourish rather than a genuine glimpse into the phone\u2019s components. For example, a curious semi-circle of frosted glass beneath the flash doesn't seem to have a purpose (beyond an aesthetic one).</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, a red square next to the ultrawide camera now acts as a recording light. It's another charming touch that can be disabled in the settings if you find it distracting. The off-center telephoto camera lens might also irk symmetry fans, but it's a choice that I don't particularly mind. The Phone 3 is 18 percent thinner than the Phone 2 and, without the camera bump of the 3a Pro, it looks and feels a step above its predecessors.</p> \n<p>The main attraction is the Glyph Matrix: a circular dot-matrix display made of 489 LEDs that shows simple notifications, the time and battery level. While some loyal fans might miss the bold light show of previous models, this iteration is far more useful. Instead of a barrage of flashing lights, the Matrix can tell you who is calling through unique patterns and, with future updates, custom art assigned to your contacts.</p> \n<p>Nothing continues to lean into its retro tech design inspiration, and I'll admit I'm a sucker for it. The dot-matrix text and numbers align perfectly with Nothing's Android skin, making the entire device feel cohesive. A capacitive haptic Glyph button beneath the Matrix lets you cycle through notifications and tools. Interactions are simple: a short press to switch modes or a long press to start tools like the stopwatch.</p> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Nothing Phone 3 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/bd58bef0-6e34-11f0-91dc-c768660699e1\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>Fortunately, you can use the Phone 3\u2019s settings menu to assign Glyph Matrix tools and \"toys.\" Most of them are playful and frivolous, like Spin The Bottle and Magic 8 Ball, and Nothing is tapping into its community to create new Matrix widgets. Hopefully, functionality will expand as more users get involved. Some tools are less useful though, like a level that uses the phone\u2019s accelerometer for a pixelated readout. It just seems a little imprecise; how much accuracy can you derive from less than 500 pixels? Others are quite slick, like a pixelated camera readout for framing selfies.</p> \n<p>With Essential Notifications, you can assign specific app notifications or contacts to a unique pattern or a pixelated photo. However, it's challenging to create anything that doesn't look like a blurry mess. The same settings menu allows you to adjust the Matrix's brightness and how long the notifications persist.</p> \n<p>The front of the Phone 3 is all display, with a 6.67-inch screen and a resolution of 2,800 x 1,260. If you prefer a large screen, this is probably its biggest advantage over the iPhone 16 and Galaxy S25. It\u2019s also Nothing\u2019s brightest phone yet, reaching up to 4,500 nits for HDR content \u2014 noticeably brighter than the Nothing Phone 3a. It supports HDR 10+ and a 120Hz refresh rate, all protected by Gorilla Glass 7.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-cameras\">Cameras</h2> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Nothing Phone 3 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/25bfa730-6e33-11f0-8f9c-65aeceb45643\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>Nothing has the fundamentals covered with the Phone 3\u2019s cameras. The triple-camera system includes a 50-megapixel f/1.7 main sensor with optical image stabilization, a 50MP ultrawide and a new 50MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom.</p> \n<p>As we noted in our Nothing Phone 3a review, telephoto cameras are rare on more affordable smartphones. On the Phone 3, there\u2019s a periscope zoom, keeping the camera unit svelte and barely protruding from the device. It\u2019s also impressive to see a 3x zoom paired with a high-resolution 50-megapixel sensor, which allows you to crop into images while retaining fidelity. Nothing even added a 6x zoom button in the camera app that crops the image further. The app also uses pixel-binning for more accurate color and better low-light pictures by default, which results in them being saved as 12-megapixel images.</p>  \n<p>Overall, the camera system can be a little inconsistent. During a vacation in Amsterdam, the Phone 3 captured crisp images of wildlife and architecture. Its Action mode was particularly impressive, effortlessly adding motion blur to shots while keeping the subject sharp. However, at other times, what should have been vibrant cityscape shots and street art came out muted and grainy. For example, psychedelic cat artwork that was incredibly vibrant in person looked flat in the photos. The metadata revealed the phone had cranked up the ISO, a setting I haven't had to manually adjust on a smartphone in years.While some color variation between the three lenses is expected, images often looked as if they were taken on different phones, something that was especially evident in scenes with blue skies.</p> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Nothing Phone 3 sample images\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/73a9ce40-6ef0-11f0-abef-061d3bc09967\" style=\"height: 968px; width: 1720px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>The telephoto camera is the standout feature on the Phone 3. I love the ability to play with zoom, and the 3x optical zoom (plus the additional crop) makes this a more useful camera than those on the iPhone 16 or Pixel 9, which top out at 2x zoom. It\u2019s also an excellent macro camera, using the zoom to prevent the phone from casting a shadow on the subject.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-software\">Software</h2> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Nothing Phone 3 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/25c06a80-6e33-11f0-b9f6-b41ac1379505\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>Nothing once again outfits its phone with its own distinctive Android skin. The aesthetic is all monochrome, serif fonts and dot-matrix touches. I immediately chose this skin when setting up the phone for the first time, though finding some app icons can be more challenging without their original colors.</p> \n<p>Essential Space, with its dedicated hardware button, remains Nothing\u2019s most interesting software addition. Since launching on the Nothing Phone 3a, it can now add events to your Google Calendar, remind you of tasks and summarize audio recordings. My biggest issue, however, is accidentally hitting the power button instead of the Essential Key, or vice versa. The keys need to be a different size or at least have a more distinct feel.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-performance-and-battery-life\">Performance and battery life</h2> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-\"></h2> \n<p>With a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 processor, the Phone 3 performs solidly, but it\u2019s not as snappy as a device with true flagship silicon, like the Snapdragon 8 Elite or Apple A18. Some might argue that the Phone 3 isn't a \"true flagship\" because its processor can be found in sub-$400 devices, but the chip is still powerful enough for most tasks and games, and can even deliver ray-traced graphics.</p> \n<p>Nothing opted for a 5,150mAh silicon-carbon battery, making it one of the first phones we\u2019ve tested with this new technology. It can store more lithium ions than traditional lithium-ion batteries, which Nothing claims adds a 10 percent boost in energy density compared to its predecessor. I didn\u2019t feel any notable difference of the Phone 3 running cooler, however. In our battery rundown test, the Phone 3 was able to play a video file for just over 23 hours. That falls slightly shy of the Phone 2, but that has a smaller screen.</p> \n<p>The Phone 3 also gets flagship-level charging speeds, supporting 65W wired charging that gets the device from empty to full in under an hour (with a compatible charger). It also supports 15W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging for earbuds. However, the lack of Qi2 support seems like an oversight for a \"true flagship.\"</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wrap-up\">Wrap-up</h2> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Nothing Phone 3 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/25a604b0-6e33-11f0-b9fb-e1db803379be\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>How does Nothing\u2019s flagship phone stack up against similarly priced smartphones? The Phone 3 offers a big 6.67-inch screen, a large battery with fast charging and 256GB of storage \u2014 double the amount found in the base Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25.</p> \n<p>However, a less-than-flagship chipset and inconsistent camera performance detract from the appeal of an otherwise intriguing phone with slick software and a unique design. The Glyph Matrix is much more useful than the flashing lights of the Phone 3\u2019s predecessors, even if the design isn\u2019t quite as bold. I just hope the company continues to evolve the tools available on it.</p> \n<p>The Phone 3 is a much better phone than the two-year-old Nothing Phone 2, but it's also $200 more expensive, making any shortcomings more apparent. While I want Nothing to continue experimenting with its phones, it should probably prioritize shoring up the camera performance first.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3-review-143006151.html?src=rss",

In a new <a href=\"https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content\"><ins>Developer Update</ins></a>, the company said the decision will ensure it can &quot;confidently support the widest range of creators in the long term.&quot;</p>\n<p>Itch.io has instructed developers and creators who want their games back on the store to tick a \u201cno payments\u201d box that sits in the pricing section of a game\u2019s edit page. It adds that any game that uses &quot;individually priced files\u201d will have those files converted into free content by checking the box. The company is also introducing a new content warnings system for NSFW-tagged pages, which it says all page owners are required to update accordingly before being reindexed.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Itch.io says it has talked to one of its long-standing payment processors, Stripe, about its policies on explicit adult content, and said it will no longer be able to take payments for games deemed to be &quot;designed for sexual gratification&quot; via the platform. This is due to new restrictions enforced by Stripe\u2019s banking partners. In a <a href=\"https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content\"><ins>statement</ins></a> included in the Itch.io update, Stripe said it hasn\u2019t closed the door on the possibility of being able to support adult content again in the future. In the meantime, Itch.io says it is talking to its other payment partners about accepting the card payments Stripe is currently no longer able to process.</p>\n<p>The future of adult content on Itch.io appears to be uncertain. It was only <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/itchio-is-removing-nsfw-games-to-comply-with-payment-processors-rules-133045491.html\"><ins>last week</ins></a> that all NSFW games on the platform were deindexed and hidden, following the new payment processor policies. The sudden and frustratingly <a href=\"https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding?language=english#5:~:text=In%20particular%2C%20certain%20kinds%20of%20adult%20only%20content.\"><ins>vague</ins></a> rules <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-now-bans-games-that-violate-the-rules-and-standards-of-payment-processors-and-banks-164222173.html\"><ins>Steam</ins></a> and Itch.io introduced to remain in compliance with those payment processors have resulted in unjust casualties. This week, solo developer Cara Cadaver told <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/vile-exhumed-is-an-unjust-casualty-in-steams-sweeping-censorship-campaign-170203493.html\"><ins>Engadget</ins></a> that her game, <em>VILE: Exhumed</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>has been removed from and banned by Steam on the basis of it having scenes of &quot;sexual content with depictions of real people,&quot; a description she says is not accurate. <em>VILE: Exhumed </em>is a mainly text-based game, and has been well received in previews, landing a spot on <em>Six One Indie</em>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.sixoneindie.com/read/pax-east-2025-favorites\"><ins>Best of PAX East</ins></a> roundup back in May. Steam\u2019s decision to remove the game is not eligible for appeal.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/itchio-starts-reindexing-free-nsfw-content-152431716.html?src=rss",

This is a great deal for those who own a Switch 2 and want to take advantage of the camera functionality in games like <em>Mario Kart World</em> and that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/chillin-by-the-fire-is-a-relaxing-co-op-campfire-sim-thats-out-today-on-nintendo-switch-2-150009762.html\"><ins>recently-released campfire sim</ins></a>.</p> \n<p>This was designed specifically for Nintendo's new console, so it's a plug-and-play affair. It's actually cheaper than the official Switch 2 camera with this sale and it looks a whole lot cooler. It's a Piranha Plant from the Mario franchise. We called it a \"work of art\" <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/horis-piranha-plant-switch-2-camera-is-a-work-of-art-194430377.html\"><ins>upon encountering the device</ins></a> and that holds true today.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p> </p> \n<p>This thing is not only stylish, resembling an Amiibo more than a camera, but it's downright useful. The pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both a stand and USB extension for the device. The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console.</p> \n<p>There's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p. However, that's more than enough to capture footage of your floating head to accompany your kart as it races through the Mushroom Kingdom.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-hori-piranha-plant-camera-for-switch-2-drops-to-40-145031698.html?src=rss",

As the name suggests, it can capture 4K video at up to 30 fps, and it can also record 2.7K footage at 60 fps. There's 2x digital zoom, a 3-axis gimbal and electrical image stabilization. Plus, this model can transmit 1080p video from up to 10km away.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p> </p> \n<p>It offers level-5 wind resistance, which is nice, and can fly for up to 31 minutes per charge. The drone allows for one-tap movements and comes with a dedicated remote. Users can also access the companion app for additional controls and to access flight tutorials.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the coolest feature here is the size and form factor. The Mini 4K is small enough that it doesn't require FAA registration, so you can take it out immediately after unboxing. It's also foldable, making it easy to store when not in use. This particular model didn't make our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-drone-120046775.html\">list of the best drones</a>, but its more expensive sibling, the Mini 4 Pro, was our very favorite.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-dji-mini-4k-drone-is-on-sale-for-249-for-prime-members-150201374.html?src=rss",

Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively. Plus, they both have excellent battery life, lasting over 18 hours while playing an HD video.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The big differences in the 15-inch model mostly come down to size. The screen is obviously bigger, as is its trackpad. Other than that, it offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling.&nbsp;</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><em>Check out our coverage of the </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html\"><em>best Apple deals</em></a><em> for more discounts, and follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-macbook-air-m4-is-on-sale-for-a-record-low-price-right-now-123031575.html?src=rss",

However, there have been several leaks and rumors about the hardware side ahead of the phones' official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-are-the-latest-iphone-17-rumors-and-reports\">What are the latest iPhone 17 rumors and reports?</h2>\n<p>Not all iPhone rumors are created equal, and all should be taken with a grain of salt. As July turns to August, we've gotten &quot;leaked&quot; colors and a glimpse of a <a href=\"https://x.com/Skyfops/status/1949936265232888057\">purported iPhone 17 &quot;spotted in the wild.&quot;</a> Let's get into it below.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"1e8b110df4664bd885b51dd044d8cb47\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29 <a href=\"https://t.co/iS3PtKWqxJ\">pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ</a></p>\u2014 Fox Pupy \ud83e\udd8a\ud83e\udde1 (@Skyfops) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Skyfops/status/1949936265232888057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 28, 2025</a></blockquote>\n \n\n</div>\n<p>The pics, highlighted on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/28/iphone-17-pro-possibly-spotted-in-the-wild/\"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, show a black cased iPhone (17?) with the sort of extended top rear &quot;camera island&quot; rumored to be coming to the new Pro iPhones. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But that's not the only rumor. A &quot;tipster&quot; <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/27/iphone-17-pro-camera-rumors/\">contacted <em>MacRumors</em></a> to allege three new iPhone Pro camera features: an upgraded telephoto lens with up to 8x optical zoom (up from the current 5x); an all-new pro camera app from Apple for photos and videos; and an additional <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16-pro-hands-on-how-does-a-faux-camera-control-button-feel-so-real-191406863.html\">Camera Control button</a> on the top edge of the phone. That last one seems especially unbelievable, as it would be the third new button added to new iPhones in as many years. Do we really need <em>two</em> dedicated camera keys, in addition to the Action Button?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, on July 30, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/iphone-17-dummies-just-leaked-in-all-colors-and-theres-a-bold-new-signature-hue\"><em>Tom's Guide</em></a> highlighted an X post from <a href=\"https://x.com/SonnyDickson/status/1950325609957380405\">Sonny Dickson</a> \u2014 a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information \u2014 showing &quot;dummy&quot; iPhone 17 models in the new colors he had leaked earlier in the month (see below). While these are literally just mock-ups \u2014 not real, leaked iPhones \u2014 it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.

It's a little early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-reportedly-wants-to-split-up-the-iphones-release-schedule-164737099.html\">split</a> into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-new-iphone-17-lineup-include\">What will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?</h2>\n<p>Design leaks suggest that Apple is building an <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-said-to-be-working-on-a-significantly-thinner-iphone-180823565.html\">ultra-thin smartphone</a>, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/this-year-could-bring-the-iphone-air-and-an-entry-level-ipad-with-apple-intelligence-175059162.html\">reported</a> in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16e-review-whats-your-acceptable-compromise-020016288.html\">iPhone 16e</a>. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.</p>\n<p>An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/15/iphone-17-air-titanium-rumor/\">indicated</a> that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.</p>\n<p>Each new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple shakes up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/a-599-iphone-16e-is-a-cruel-joke-200507275.html\">a surprisingly high price point</a>, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. <em>Bloomberg</em> said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 \u2014 likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.</p>\n<p>We've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2849423/iphone-17-colors-confirmed-see-all-of-apples-2026-options-right-here.html\"><em>Macworld</em></a> reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-new-ios-be-like\">What will iOS 26 be like?</h2>\n<p>Apple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-public-beta-is-live-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-iphone-features-and-how-to-use-them-135749325.html\">iOS 26</a>.</p>\n<p>On the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html\">scaling down</a> the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.</p>\n<p>The feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">freeze FaceTime video</a> if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.</p>\n<p>iOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-will-at-long-last-let-you-customize-snooze-times-on-alarms-in-ios-26-190001600.html\">nine minute snooze alarm</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The next iOS is now available as a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-to-install-the-ios-18-public-beta-202938588.html\">public beta</a>.

To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups. You\u2019re paying for the service, so it\u2019s not technically \u201cfree,\u201d but you can get a dose of live TV without spending more than necessary. Peacock includes some regional NBC stations, and notably access to the 2024 Summer <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peacocks-2024-paris-olympics-coverage-includes-enhanced-multiview-options-190047120.html\">Olympic Games</a>. Paramount+ subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The standard Hulu app has a live ABC news channel and Max <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/a-live-cnn-streaming-channel-is-coming-to-max-in-september-141316706.html\">now includes</a> a live CNN outlet with its service, along with cable-like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/streaming-is-just-tv-all-over-again-165115834.html\">linear channels</a>.</p> \n<p>The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon\u2019s Fire TV interface has a live tab and Roku\u2019s built-in <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f3574a52-3bcf-4a37-83ee-65836ac78115&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=50eb34db-c0fc-4bfb-ab41-1cbe97faffd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Roku&amp;linkText=Roku+Channel&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5yb2t1LmNvbS93aGF0cy1vbi90aGUtcm9rdS1jaGFubmVsIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MGViMzRkYi1jMGZjLTRiZmItYWI0MS0xY2JlOTdmYWZmZDgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJva3UuY29tL3doYXRzLW9uL3RoZS1yb2t1LWNoYW5uZWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZBySIi8oQ7DlJJm5e8o1CC284MW-_AeB7ls29bMlyi6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roku.com%2Fwhats-on%2Fthe-roku-channel\">Roku Channel</a> includes hundreds of live channels at no extra cost.

Even cable company DirecTV has joined the crowd with <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=fd7207b2-1b6a-4385-aa15-2f04784de078&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=50eb34db-c0fc-4bfb-ab41-1cbe97faffd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=DIRECTV&amp;linkText=MyFree&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXJlY3R2LmNvbS9teWZyZWUtZGlyZWN0di8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUwZWIzNGRiLWMwZmMtNGJmYi1hYjQxLTFjYmU5N2ZhZmZkOCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlyZWN0di5jb20vbXlmcmVlLWRpcmVjdHYvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARy8jjkg4o0KOvGsOVsCPTp2QcB6OCmCTClKSNu70vND&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.directv.com%2Fmyfree-directv%2F\">MyFree</a>, and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9a941868-c063-4b44-9207-896f1fb5891e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=50eb34db-c0fc-4bfb-ab41-1cbe97faffd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=FuboTV&amp;linkText=Fubo+Free&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuZnViby50di9oYy9lbi11cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yNzE3NjAxMTIwOTg2OS1Ib3ctZG9lcy1GdWJvLUZyZWUtd29yayIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuZnViby50di9oYy9lbi11cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yNzE3NjAxMTIwOTg2OS1Ib3ctZG9lcy1GdWJvLUZyZWUtd29yayJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAezlVRxyeMVofUvrgWksAw2rmzH23aR6IIjpgti3IhtG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.fubo.tv%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F27176011209869-How-does-Fubo-Free-work\">Fubo Free</a> lets customers with a lapsed subscription keep watching some content. Here's the best of the live TV streaming services we tried:</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-table-of-contents\">Back to top</a></p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-live-tv-streaming-service\">What to look for in a live TV streaming service</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-to-stream-live-tv\"><strong>How to stream live TV</strong></h3> \n<p>Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html\">streaming device</a> and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-monthly-price\"><strong>Monthly Price</strong></h3> \n<p>When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html\">price difference</a> between live TV and a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-video-streaming-services-133000093.html\">standard video streaming app</a>. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks \u2014 particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service except Sling has raised base plan prices.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-local-channels\"><strong>Local channels</strong></h3> \n<p>Only two of the services I tried don\u2019t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it\u2019s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations \u2014 and only in larger markets \u2014 but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels.</p> \n<p>When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you\u2019ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area\u2019s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D9NZTGLF&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=50eb34db-c0fc-4bfb-ab41-1cbe97faffd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=HD+antenna&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAYFrBzybV7JrmQ6EI0-2SiNJpVRVKi5fSnmf_a2Xkzyj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAntenna-Outdoor-Reception-Supports-Channels%2Fdp%2FB0D9NZTGLF\">HD antenna</a>, you\u2019ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era.</p> \n<p>But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area\u2019s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/netflix-signs-deal-to-host-live-tv-channels-in-france-153852590.html\">recently announced deal</a> with one of France\u2019s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it\u2019s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-live-sports-coverage\"><strong>Live sports coverage</strong></h3> \n<p>One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=upcoming+nfl+games\">upcoming games</a> (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the \u201cTV &amp; streaming\u201d button will tell you which network is covering it.</p> \n<p>That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don\u2019t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/disney-cuts-directv-customers-access-to-abc-espn-and-more-123047594.html\">streaming rights negotiations</a>, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates.</p> \n<p>I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=cbef8901-c2f3-4af7-b1b7-e2c3afcffd7a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=50eb34db-c0fc-4bfb-ab41-1cbe97faffd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Peacock+TV&amp;linkText=Peacock&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZWFjb2NrdHYuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZWFjb2NrdHYuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYnRVh_g_jgVhSp7LBrtJVkcMpZ3bn_n25jQbBiVS3P6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peacocktv.com%2F\">Peacock</a> carries <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peacock-ui-update-183247828.html\">live</a> Premier League matches, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peacocks-nfl-wild-card-game-broke-streaming-records-103503762.html\">Sunday Night Football</a> games and aired the 2024 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peacocks-2024-paris-olympics-coverage-includes-enhanced-multiview-options-190047120.html\">Olympic Games</a> from Paris. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-x-ray-replays-thursday-night-football-173723667.html\">Thursday Night Football</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nba-tv-rights-go-to-espn-nbc-and-amazon-as-tnt-is-rejected-230811550.html\">NBA and WNBA games</a> are on Amazon Prime and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-stream-its-first-nfl-games-on-christmas-day-163407396.html\">Christmas Day Football</a> aired on Netflix.

While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want.</p> \n<p>And if sports is all you\u2019re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/rip-to-the-entirely-hypothetical-streaming-service-venu-sports-180532990.html\">cancelled</a> early this year.

If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won\u2019t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC.

Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them \u2014 and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-on-demand-streaming\"><strong>On-demand streaming</strong></h3> \n<p>Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn\u2019t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET\u2019s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play.</p> \n<p>Partnerships, like Hulu\u2019s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you\u2019re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-digital-video-recordings-dvr-limits\"><strong>Digital video recordings (DVR) limits</strong></h3> \n<p>Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You\u2019ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you\u2019ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events.</p> \n<p>Aside from being able to watch whenever it\u2019s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can\u2019t skip them on live TV or VOD.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-simultaneous-streams-and-profiles-per-account\"><strong>Simultaneous streams and profiles per account</strong></h3> \n<p>Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP\u2019s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens.</p> \n<p>Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-picture-in-picture-mode-and-multiview\"><strong>Picture-in-picture mode and multiview</strong></h3> \n<p>Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple live sports games at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV and FuboTV are the only live TV streamers that let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-4k-live-streams\"><strong>4K live streams</strong></h3> \n<p>Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams \u2014 but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/10383365?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid\">$20-per-month add-on</a>, after which you\u2019ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=fd7207b2-1b6a-4385-aa15-2f04784de078&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=50eb34db-c0fc-4bfb-ab41-1cbe97faffd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=DIRECTV&amp;linkText=three+channels&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXJlY3R2LmNvbS9zdXBwb3J0L2FydGljbGUvMDAwMDkzNTEzIzp-OnRleHQ9TGl2ZSUyMDRLJTIwc3RyZWFtaW5nJTIwY2hhbm5lbHMlM0EsTElWRTRLMiklMjAlRTIlODAlOTMlMjBvY2Nhc2lvbmFsJTIwbGl2ZSUyMHNwb3J0aW5nJTIwZXZlbnRzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MGViMzRkYi1jMGZjLTRiZmItYWI0MS0xY2JlOTdmYWZmZDgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpcmVjdHYuY29tL3N1cHBvcnQvYXJ0aWNsZS8wMDAwOTM1MTMjOn46dGV4dD1MaXZlJTIwNEslMjBzdHJlYW1pbmclMjBjaGFubmVscyUzQSxMSVZFNEsyKSUyMCVFMiU4MCU5MyUyMG9jY2FzaW9uYWwlMjBsaXZlJTIwc3BvcnRpbmclMjBldmVudHMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfBOZeOCs_mDWZxqAtOv4p2bzWJin4372k1YbK5zuEsQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.directv.com%2Fsupport%2Farticle%2F000093513%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DLive%25204K%2520streaming%2520channels%253A%2CLIVE4K2%29%2520%25E2%2580%2593%2520occasional%2520live%2520sporting%2520events\">three channels</a> that show live 4K content \u2014 one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events.

I\u2026 made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-to-stream-live-tv-for-free\"><strong>How to stream live TV for free</strong></h3> \n<p>I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/youtube-is-testing-a-hub-of-free-cable-style-channels-192518784.html\">FAST</a>) including <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=50eb34db-c0fc-4bfb-ab41-1cbe97faffd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Freevee&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2dwL3ZpZGVvL3NwbGFzaC9mcmVldmVlX2ZpbmR1cz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MGViMzRkYi1jMGZjLTRiZmItYWI0MS0xY2JlOTdmYWZmZDgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vZ3AvdmlkZW8vc3BsYXNoL2ZyZWV2ZWVfZmluZHVzIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARSjkmnkz3GBqaCsuITtxGWZbLEL7-4c9Dq2bCDEJlxS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fvideo%2Fsplash%2Ffreevee_findus\">Freevee</a>, <a href=\"https://tubitv.com/\">Tubi</a>, <a href=\"https://pluto.tv/welcome\">PlutoTV</a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34c77505-6db4-4664-9320-2c38b4122d5e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=50eb34db-c0fc-4bfb-ab41-1cbe97faffd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sling+TV&amp;linkText=Sling+Freestream&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbGluZy5jb20vZnJlZXN0cmVhbSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbGluZy5jb20vZnJlZXN0cmVhbSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaPq6YMd5yy0gvP1qP9zpcespJW1yApZRTBDFv6_MD1C&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Ffreestream\">Sling Freestream</a>.

For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/most-watched-channels-2024-tv-network-ratings-1236259845/\">top cable networks</a> were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons.</p> \n<p>I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app\u2019s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of <em>Home Town</em>.</p> \n<p>I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks.</p> \n<p><strong>All live TV streaming services we\u2019ve tested:</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\"

id=\"jump-link-what-is-live-streaming\"><strong>What is live streaming?</strong></h3> \n<p>Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. <em>Live</em> streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-the-difference-between-streaming-and-live-streaming\"><strong>What is the difference between streaming and live streaming?</strong></h3> \n<p>Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It\u2019s also referred to as \u201cvideo on demand.\u201d Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-streaming-service-is-best-for-live-tv\"><strong>What streaming service is best for live TV?</strong></h3> \n<p>FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-the-most-cost-effective-tv-streaming-service\"><strong>What is the most cost effective TV streaming service?</strong></h3> \n<p>Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won\u2019t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you\u2019re not paying for stuff you don\u2019t need.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-is-it-cheaper-to-have-cable-or-streaming\"><strong>Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming?</strong></h3> \n<p>A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that\u2019s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-streaming-service-has-all-the-tv-channels\"><strong>What streaming service has all the TV channels?</strong></h3> \n<p>No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/most-watched-channels-2024-tv-network-ratings-1236259845/\">according to Neilsen</a>. Hulu\u2019s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can\u2019t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-the-most-popular-live-tv-streaming-platform\"><strong>What is the most popular live TV streaming platform?</strong></h3> \n<p>YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/2024-letter-from-neal/\">letter</a> from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney\u2019s 2024 third quarter <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/11/disney-earnings-inside-out-2-deadpool-wolverine-disney-hulu-streaming-theme-parks-1236176347/\">earnings</a> put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling\u2019s <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sling-tv-slips-below-2-135658433.html\">customer count dipped</a> from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to <a href=\"https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2024/Fubo-Closed-Q3-2024-With-21-Year-over-Year-Revenue-Growth-and-1.613M-Subscribers-in-North-America/default.aspx\">1.6 million</a>.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-safe-are-free-streaming-services-and-websites\"><strong>How safe are free streaming services and websites?</strong></h3> \n<p>You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That\u2019s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series \u2014 which can come bundled with malicious code.</p> \n<p>But if you\u2019re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Freevee, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don\u2019t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous than apps that require login credentials.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-table-of-contents\">Back to top</a></p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-recent-updates\"><strong>Recent updates</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>January 31, 2025</strong>: Added information about which streaming service would live-stream the Super Bowl, including Tubi\u2019s free option. Updated Fubo\u2019s pricing. Added details about DirectTV Stream\u2019s sports-only package and Comcast\u2019s sports and news bundle.</p> \n<p><strong>January 16, 2025</strong>: Included higher prices for Sling\u2019s Orange and Blue plans. Noted the demise of the never-launched Venu sports streaming service and mentioned the inclusion of DirecTV\u2019s new sports package.</p> \n<p><strong>December 31, 2024</strong>: Noted increased pricing for YouTube TV, Hulu+ Live TV and DirecTV. Updated information for 4K streaming capabilities and requirements for multiple services. Reported on the upcoming shut down of Amazon\u2019s Freevee service and the addition of DirecTV\u2019s free service.</p> \n<p><strong>August 6, 2024</strong>: Updated with the addition of Plex as a free live TV streaming recommendation and mentioned the additional free channels Philo is now including with the free version of its service. Added pricing information for ESPN's new sports-only streaming service, Venu.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>June 12, 2024</strong>: Updated with more information about 4K live streaming, picture-in-picture and multiview modes, as well as video on-demand options. We expanded our recommendations around free live TV streaming services and added a FAQ query about the safety of free streaming services and clarified the difference between standard and live streaming. More traditional streaming services have added live and sports components, so we revised that section accordingly.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-table-of-contents\">Back to top</a></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html?src=rss",

The line stood out, as Zuckerberg has made open source pretty central to Meta's approach to AI.</p>\n<p>In fact, his comments differ from what he wrote almost exactly a year ago in a different memo titled &quot;Open Source AI is the Path Forward.&quot; In that, he said that open source is crucial for both Meta and developers.</p>\n<p>The new memo is pretty meandering, and Zuckerberg followed up with comments on Meta\u2019s Q2 earnings call, saying that nothing had particularly changed.

Some solid upgrades here will appeal to serious athletes and power users, but with a starting price of nearly $400, are those upgrades worth an extra $100 - $200 compared to the Ray-Ban iteration? Maybe not. We know that Meta will add displays and, eventually, full augmented reality capabilities to its wearable glasses. They are also likely to cost significantly more than these.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-glasses-review-a-familiar-formula-with-some-upgrades-120026844.html\"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/the-morning-after-engadget-newsletter-111516821.html?src=rss",

In the coming weeks, the company is also adding support for PDF uploads on desktop, which could help you digest lengthy course or work materials. You can ask AI Mode to summarize the documents for you and ask follow-up questions that it will then answer by cross-referencing the materials you uploaded with information available on the web. Google says AI Mode's responses will also include links to its references that you can visit in order to dig deeper. AI Mode will support additional file types for upload, including ones straight from your Google Drive, in the coming months as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to PDF upload support, Google is also rolling out a new Canvas feature that you can access if you're enrolled in the AI Mode Labs experiment in the US. You can use Canvas to consolidate all relevant information about a specific topic or for a specific purpose in a side panel that updates as you ask AI Mode more follow-up questions. If you're traveling, for instance, you can ask AI Mode to make you an itinerary and click the Create Canvas button. You'll be able to keep refining the itinerary with more questions, and you can always leave it alone for a while and come back to it later.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>AI Mode's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-ai-powered-search-live-feature-is-here-to-further-cannibalize-the-internet-160018513.html\">Search Live</a> is also getting video input on mobile this week, a feature Google <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-search-live-will-let-you-ask-questions-about-what-your-camera-sees-174532593.html\">announced at I/O 2025</a>, after voice input arrived in June. To be able to access video input, you'll have to open Lens in the Google app and tap the Live icon before asking questions on what the camera sees. When Google revealed the feature during its annual developers' event, it said you could point the camera at a math problem, for example, and ask Search to help you solve it or to explain a concept you're having trouble understanding.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, with Lens in Chrome, you'll be able to ask AI Mode what's on your desktop screen. The company will roll out an &quot;Ask Google about this page&quot; dropdown option in the address bar &quot;soon.&quot; When you click on it, AI Mode will create an overview with key information on what's being shown on your screen on the side panel, whether it's a web page or a PDF. That side panel will also contain a new &quot;Dive Deeper&quot; button that gives you a way to ask AI Mode specific questions about you've selected on your screen with Lens on desktop.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Updated August 1, 2025 5:45AM ET:</strong> This story has been updated to add information on &quot;Dive Deeper.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Update, July 29 2025, 12:29PM ET:</strong> This story has been updated, as Google shared after the article was published that the image and PDF upload features will be available wherever AI Mode is available, not just in the US. That means those uploads will come to the US, India and the UK.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-is-bringing-image-and-pdf-uploads-to-ai-mode-160050646.html?src=rss",

Most iPad covers are cases that surround the back of your tablet and have a flap that covers the screen, so it provides protection for the body as well as its display. Plenty of iPad cases also have screen covers, but you don\u2019t have to get one with that feature. Instead, you could just get a case that hugs the back of the tablet and nothing else. Those accessories will be marginally thinner and lighter than their cover-toting counterparts, and give your iPad a more svelte profile.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-often-should-i-charge-my-ipad\">How often should I charge my iPad?</h3> \n<p>How often you charge your iPad will depend on how often you use it. Most iPads will last at least a regular work day with frequent usage, which is one of the reasons why many have opted to use their iPads as laptop replacements. But with heavy usage, like constant video streaming or gaming, will come more rapid battery drain. A good rule of thumb is to charge your iPad when you go to sleep each night, that way you\u2019ll have a topped-up device waiting for you in the morning.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ipad-cases-to-protect-your-tablet-130033533.html?src=rss",

Plenty have chosen VOD and<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html\"> live TV streaming services</a> over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-is-increasing-prices-again-for-standalone-streaming-plans-183518837.html\"> consistently</a><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/discovery-is-raising-prices-for-all-customers-160646636.html\"> raising</a><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-raises-subscription-praises-again-with-its-standard-plan-now-costing-18-per-month-234344714.html\"> prices</a> to the point where you may question<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/is-streaming-video-even-still-worth-it-192651141.html\"> if streaming is even worth it anymore</a>.</p> \n<p>We at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don\u2019t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you\u2019re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-streaming-deals\">Best streaming deals</h2> \n<p>True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they\u2019ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we\u2019ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you\u2019ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.</p> \n<p>If you\u2019re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You\u2019ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you\u2019re fine paying full price for it \u2014 that\u2019s the ideal situation. But if you\u2019re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apps/how-to-find-and-cancel-your-unused-subscriptions-130036314.html\">cancel</a> at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><a href=\"https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/\"><strong>YouTube TV (two months) for $120 ($46 off)</strong></a>: You can get two months of our favorite <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html\">live TV streaming service</a> for $60 per month which works out to $46 less than paying the full $83 each month. And right now, the service is free for the first 21 days. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you.

These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you\u2019ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.</p> \n<p>Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9c431828-c2cf-402b-a23c-df7fba43d348&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=026fe1b5-ea22-49f6-8016-fd8686928f5c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney+Store&amp;linkText=Disney%2B%2C+Hulu%2C+HBO+Max+bundle+with+ads+for+%2417%2Fmonth&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNuZXlwbHVzLmNvbS93ZWxjb21lL2Rpc25leS1odWx1LW1heC1idW5kbGUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjAyNmZlMWI1LWVhMjItNDlmNi04MDE2LWZkODY4NjkyOGY1YyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vd2VsY29tZS9kaXNuZXktaHVsdS1tYXgtYnVuZGxlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAduD_oqRyynLYkzWzDFLK1tpl2rJVpZNu-qVQ1XrfSaQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2Fdisney-hulu-max-bundle\"><strong>Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu.

It is  believed to have shipped its two billionth sometime in 2021, and now only four years later, it has reached the new milestone. Apple's CEO said the iPhone enjoyed a double digit growth in the third quarter and that the company earned $94 billion in revenue, up 10 percent year over year. In a tweet, Apple expert Mark Gurman suggested that iPhone sales over the past quarter were driven by people who bought one out of fear that the device would be out of their reach in the future due to Trump's tariffs.&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"ae1f43673aa6474a935b9af924fae27d\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Apple should be very pleased with the folks who spread the lies that the iPhone will cost $3000 or $25,000 if made in the U.S. Clearly that helped a ton for the June quarter.</p>\u2014 Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1951022709980405841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote>\n \n\n</div>\n<p>Speaking of tariffs, they cost the company $800 million in the quarter ending in June, Cook said during the call. In the next quarter ending in September, Apple believes tariffs will <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/apple-projects-tariff-costs-will-hit-1-1b-next-quarter/\">cost the company $1.1 billion</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Apple is slated to announce its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-max-and-air-everything-we-know-about-apples-new-phones-153024282.html\">next iPhone models</a> in a matter of weeks, probably sometime in September like last year's devices. Gurman previously reported that Apple is releasing an iPhone 17 Air this generation to match the Air models of its other products. It will reportedly be an ultra-thin phone, as its designation implies, will have a single camera lens and be powered by a basic A19 chip. The phone could also be equipped with Apple's in-house modem that debuted with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16e-review-whats-your-acceptable-compromise-020016288.html\">iPhone 16e</a> and come with a 6.6-inch screen. It could cost buyers around $900, which is around $100 more than the base iPhone 16 and is on par with the price of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-iphone-16-and-iphone-16-plus-review-closing-the-gap-to-the-pro-120050824.html\">iPhone 16 Plus</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to announcing Apple's three billionth iPhone, Cook also announced during the call that the company is &quot;significantly growing out investments&quot; <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-open-to-acquisitions-to-boost-its-ai-roadmap-221925560.html\">in artificial intelligence</a>. He said an acquisition to boost its AI efforts and accelerate its roadmap wasn't out of the question, though he didn't name any specific company that Apple could potentially purchase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-has-now-shipped-3-billion-iphones-030851439.html?src=rss",

The company has already been working on a plan to integrate its LLM-powered search into its main search feature, but CEO Steve Huffman said he wants users to think of the site as an actual search engine.</p>\n<p>During the company's latest earnings call, Huffman said search is one of the top priorities for Reddit. &quot;We're concentrating our resources on the areas that will drive results for our most pressing needs, improving the core product, making Reddit a go-to search engine, and expanding internationally.&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The idea of reddit as a search engine isn't that far-fetched. Many people are already in the habit of adding &quot;Reddit&quot; to traditional searches in the hopes of finding relevant threads from the site. And the company has been trying to take advantage of this with its own AI-powered search product <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-introduces-ai-powered-reddit-answers-search-feature-140028655.html\"><ins>Reddit Answers</ins></a>. Though that feature is still labeled as being in &quot;beta,&quot; the company plans to eventually add it to its default search bar.</p>\n<p>&quot;Our focus right now is on unifying the Reddit search, like traditional search on Reddit, which is very widely used on Reddit, and the new Reddit answers product ... we're unifying those into a single search experience, and we're going to bring that front and center in the app,&quot; Huffman said.</p>\n<p>Huffman's comments come at a time when AI is increasingly <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/cloudflare-ceo-says-people-arent-checking-ai-chatbots-source-links-120016921.html\"><ins>eating search traffic</ins></a> for websites. It sounds like even Reddit, which has a multimillion-dollar data licensing <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/reddit-is-licensing-its-content-to-google-to-help-train-its-ai-models-200013007.html\"><ins>deal with Google</ins></a>, isn't immune from those trends either. During the call, Huffman said that Reddit's search traffic from Google &quot;varies week to week,&quot; but that overall &quot;it was a headwind&quot; during the last quarter.</p>\n<p>That may help explain why Huffman is so eager to make Reddit itself a search destination, even as the company continues to license its data to AI companies. &quot;AI doesn't invent knowledge,&quot; he said. &quot;It learns from us; from real people, sharing real perspectives.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-should-be-a-go-to-search-engine-steve-huffman-says-230039621.html?src=rss",

The signature Conquest, Rush and Breakthrough modes will return in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, as well as typical FPS fare such as Team Deathmatch, Squad Deathmatch, Domination and King of the Hill. The new game mode coming this fall is called Escalation, where teams will face off to control and hold several capture points. On the map front, there are new locations in Egypt, Gibraltar, Tajikistan and Brooklyn, plus at least one familiar one: a remake of Operation Firestorm from Battlefield 3.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>There will be four familiar classes for players to choose from: Assault, Support, Recon and Engineer. Other tweaks showcased in the multiplayer content unveiled today include a new Drag and Revive option, where downed teammates can be lugged to a safer spot before you rez them, and an option for wall-mounting weapons for less recoil. There will also be plenty of opportunities for high-tech environmental destruction between the tanks, rocket launchers, aerial assaults and drone-mounted explosives. Or you can keep it simple and smash stuff with a really big hammer.</p>\n<p>If you can't wait until October 10 to get into the combat, <em>Battlefield 6</em> will have two open beta weekends on August 9-10 and August 14-17.

Margaret McKeown, who oversaw the case, writes.</p>\n<p>&quot;This decision will significantly harm user safety, limit choice, and undermine the innovation that has always been central to the Android ecosystem,&quot; Lee-Anne Mullholand, Google's Global Head of Regulatory Affairs, told Engadget. &quot;Our top priority remains protecting our users, developers and partners, and maintaining a secure platform as we continue our appeal.&quot; Google intends to appeal the Ninth Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>The origin of the <em>Epic v. Google</em> lawsuit was Epic's decision to <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-fortnite-direct-payment-discounts-143422257.html\">circumvent Google's payment system</a> via a software update to <em>Fortnite. </em>When Google caught wind, it <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-android-225437892.html\">removed <em>Fortnite</em> from the Play Store</a> and Epic sued. Epic pulled a similar gambit with Apple and the App Store, though was far less successful in winning concessions in that case \u2014 its major judicial success there has been preventing Apple from <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html\">collecting fees from developers</a> on purchases made using third-party payment systems.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-lost-its-antitrust-case-with-epic-again-190633325.html?src=rss",

In the <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/newsroom/merchant-product/\"><ins>press release</ins></a>, Uber Eats shows an example in which pictures captured very close to the food are transformed into wider field-of-view shots of plated dishes.

Much like the generated images, the jury is still out on if these tools will be useful, or another vector for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fake-book-list-ai-newspaper-summer-reading-fcdf454a5b467dad3adfed6ca1a224d2\"><ins>hallucinations</ins></a>.</p>\n<p>Uber is inviting users to send photos of delivered food for items that lack menu images.

            "summary": "<p>Over the past few weeks, thousands of video games have been banned, removed and delisted from Steam and Itch.io. The justifications for doing so have been almost comically vague, and at least one highly anticipated title is now unable to be sold despite containing nothing objectionable.</p>\n<p>It started in early July, when payment processors including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal established new regulations concerning the types of games they would allow to be sold on the PC gaming platforms they support. The exact details of these regulations have not been made public. What we do know is that, in response on July 16, Steam added a sweepingly vague clause to its ruleset banning \u201c<a href=\"https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding?language=english#5:~:text=In%20particular%2C%20certain%20kinds%20of%20adult%20only%20content.\">certain kinds of adult only content</a>.\u201d Hundreds of games were <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-now-bans-games-that-violate-the-rules-and-standards-of-payment-processors-and-banks-164222173.html\">removed</a> from the platform. On July 24, Itch.io rolled out <a href=\"https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content#addendum-faq\">its own rule change</a> and summarily <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/itchio-is-removing-nsfw-games-to-comply-with-payment-processors-rules-133045491.html\">deindexed</a> every adult and NSFW game it hosted, which amounted to more than 20,000 titles being hidden from search and browse pages. Itch.io is currently auditing this bunch and preparing to introduce new compliance measures for NSFW games.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Among the games swept up in this tidal wave of censorship is <em>VILE: Exhumed,</em> the latest project from solo developer Cara Cadaver of Final Girl Games and publisher DreadXP.</p>\n<div id=\"0e97f35403454ef9b2c87980113f0d97\"></div>\n<p><em>VILE: Exhumed </em>takes place in the files and preserved BBS chatrooms of an old PC, as players hunt for clues in the disappearance of adult film actress Candy Corpse. It\u2019s an unsettling psychological experience that\u2019s mainly text-based, and it offers pixelated commentary on misogyny, sexual entitlement and parasocial relationships. <em>VILE: Exhumed</em> has been <a href=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3889302/terminal-terror-four-new-games-that-find-horror-in-a-computer-screen/\">praised</a> in <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/bite-size-horror-vile-is-uncomfortable-important-and-truly-therapeutic-and-its-coming-to-make-you-squirm-on-steam/\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/vile-exhumed-confronts-you-with-the-unsettling-realities-of-digital-obsession-and-misogynistic-entitlement/\">previews</a>, even earning a place in <em>Six One Indie\u2019</em>s <a href=\"https://www.sixoneindie.com/read/pax-east-2025-favorites\">Best of PAX East</a> lineup this May. It was slated to hit Steam on July 22.</p>\n<p>As DreadXP director Hunter Bond and his team continued preparing the game for launch, they noticed it was taking an abnormally long time for Steam to approve its page. They submitted tickets to Steam asking for a status update, but heard nothing concrete back. The day before <em>VILE: Exhumed </em>was supposed to come out, Cara and DreadXP were forced to announce <a href=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3889187/vile-exhumed-delayed-from-tomorrows-release/\">a delay</a>. And On July 28, Cara <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/dirtlord77.bsky.social/post/3lv2264j6sk2c\">announced</a> <em>VILE: Exhumed </em>had been removed from Steam and banned from the platform.</p>\n<p>Steam told Cara that the action was triggered by scenes of \u201csexual content with depictions of real people,\u201d a description that she said doesn\u2019t apply to her game, since it deals in text and implication. The ban is not eligible for appeal and <em>VILE: Exhumed</em> can not be resubmitted to Steam. This effectively removes it from the mainstream PC gaming conversation, since Steam essentially enjoys a monopoly in the market and there isn\u2019t a competing storefront with the same audience reach in town. Losing Steam access is a huge blow for small developers especially.</p>\n<p><em>VILE: Exhumed</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/bite-size-horror-vile-is-uncomfortable-important-and-truly-therapeutic-and-its-coming-to-make-you-squirm-on-steam/\">deeply personal</a> project for Cara, one that she worked on for years. \u201cI poured myself into this game \u2014 it was an incredibly personal story, made up of bits and pieces of my real-life experiences, my real feelings, and was reflective of that for many other people as well,&quot; Cara told Engadget. &quot;Silencing a story about violence, entitlement and sexual expression (though the sexual content was all implied) shows the age we are living in, and I deeply worry for storytelling and art.\u201d</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"VILE: Exhumed\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/c700d6b0-6e2d-11f0-bf2e-fa040a20dd83\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Cara Cadaver</div></figure>\n<p>To put it clearly: Steam removed a solo female developer\u2019s game about misogynistic violence and banned her from attempting to list it ever again, and the platform\u2019s reason for doing so doesn\u2019t make sense to anyone who knows what\u2019s actually in the game. You can decide that for yourself, too: At least one full playthrough of <em>VILE: Exhumed</em> lives happily <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I34oGWkOQLk\">on YouTube</a>, a site not known for tolerant views on nudity or adult themes. More confusingly, the original version of Cara\u2019s game, <a href=\"https://final-girl-games.itch.io/vile\"><em>VILE</em></a>, remains available and searchable on Itch.io's storefront, even though it includes much of the same content as <em>Exhumed</em>.</p>\n<p>This highlights a core issue with Steam and Itchi.io\u2019s sudden and haphazard censorship plans. Vague rules against \u201cadult-only content\u201d leave too much room for interpretation and invite overreach \u2014 especially in a society that\u2019s increasingly hostile to marginalized communities \u2014 while simultaneously doing very little to protect the audience from whatever demons the payment processors think they have identified. The rollout of the new regulations has been chaotic and already multiple games, including the horror hit <em>Mouthwashing</em>, have been <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/itch.io/post/3lv2gsf3jlk2x\">inaccurately identified</a> as casualties of the situation.</p>\n<p>Engadget has reached out to Visa, Mastercard and PayPal for information on what their new policies are and why they're being enacted. Only PayPal has responded with a generic statement that it does not comment on individual accounts. Valve has also not returned requests for comment. Itch.io did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"VILE: Exhumed\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/c700d6b0-6e2d-11f0-8f7f-1260e85ec600\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Cara Cadaver</div></figure>\n<p>This isn\u2019t the first time Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and other major payment processors have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-02-paypal-square-and-big-bankings-war-on-the-sex-industry.html\">targeted online communities</a> for censorship. The current PC gaming bans mirror previous efforts to restrict content on PornHub, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/onlyfans-suspends-ban-on-sexually-explicit-content-132256309.html\">OnlyFans</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-27-patreon-adult-content-crowdfunding-uncertainty.html\">Patreon</a>, to name a few targets. This sort of financial censorship, the Electronic Frontier Foundation <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/financial-censorship\">says</a>, &quot;can heavily influence what kind of speech can exist online.\u201d</p>\n<p>The International Game Developers Association has <a href=\"https://igda.org/news-archive/press-release-statement-on-game-delistings/\">lodged its fierce opposition</a> to the censorship campaign, and provides avenues for players to contact Visa and Mastercard directly with their concerns.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are alarmed by the vague enforcement of policies delisting and deplatforming legal, consensual, and ethically-developed games, especially from LGBTQ+ and marginalized creators,\u201d the IGDA said. \u201cDevelopers deserve clear rules, fair warnings, and the right to appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>VILE: Exhumed</em>, Steam is silencing a game that can help combat gender-based sexual violence, in the name of protecting players from being harmed by these same themes. <em>VILE: Exhumed</em> is uncomfortable, confronting, personal and raw \u2014 and that\u2019s the beauty of small, independent games. By all accounts, it doesn\u2019t belong in the Steam ban, and it\u2019s also likely not the only game unfairly swept up in the broad censorship campaigns hitting PC platforms, pushed by payment processors.</p>\n<p>&quot;Indie development for me has been such a beautiful opportunity to create things and tell stories that mean something to me \u2014 and I hate that that freedom of expression is being taken from myself and others,&quot; Cara said.

This is the first time we're seeing a version of the original title on a Nintendo platform <a href=\"https://plantsvszombies.fandom.com/wiki/Plants_vs._Zombies_(Nintendo_DS)\"><ins>since the DS</ins></a>.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"7459d2d55c894a7dbfaefaa321e3f0e7\"></div>\n<p>This is more than just a simple HD refresh. The graphics have been upscaled, which is nice, but EA has also added new levels and plenty of secrets to uncover. The refresh will even include local co-op and PvP, which should be fun. The PSN and Xbox Live Arcade versions of the game, released in the early 2010s, had a co-op mode, but not's not true of many other iterations.</p>\n<p>Preorders are open right now, and early birds will receive a retro Peashooter skin when the game launches. It remains to be seen if the game will come to other platforms beyond Nintendo's hybrid consoles. However, it's very likely to pop up on just about everything before too long.</p>\n<div id=\"0d836664f8934bbd91610d0244736f87\"></div>\n<p>As for the rest of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/a-nintendo-direct-focused-on-third-party-games-is-taking-place-on-july-31-133158933.html\"><ins>today's Nintendo Direct</ins></a>, it was a muted affair focusing on third-party titles.

In 2024, taxis accounted for 90 percent of Freenow\u2019s income and they will remain the &quot;backbone&quot; of its business going forward.</p>\n<p>As well as seamless app integration in the future, Freenow said in April that riders can expect more consistent pricing, faster matching and new features as a result of the Lyft acquisition.

It connects via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or with a physical cable. It's compatible with devices running Windows 10 and above and Android 9.0 and above. The battery life is solid, with around 32 hours per charge on Bluetooth and 19 hours when using the wireless 2.4G adapter.</p> \n<p>As for the actual controller, it boasts Hall Effect joysticks that are precise and durable. There's an extra set of bumpers that can be remapped without additional software. It offers 6-axis control and haptic feedback, aka rumble. It's a decent little controller, particularly for the price.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/8bitdos-ultimate-2c-controller-is-on-sale-for-only-18-150801451.html?src=rss",

This is a campfire sim from Oink Games in which you'll build and grow a fire. You'll split and stack firewood, dry out wet logs before adding them to your blaze and fan the flames by blowing on 'em. It's important not to have too little or too much wood in a fire at any given time, and you might have to deal with elemental factors like low temperatures on a snowy mountain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The main aim of <em>Chillin' by the Fire </em>is to build a level 10 blaze, but there are other ways to play. In survival mode, you'll have a limited stock of firewood and have to figure out how to pass the flame between logs to keep it burning. There's also a multiplayer feature called Playground, in which you can compete with friends to construct the biggest fire (messing with them is an option here) or work together.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p><em>Chillin' by the Fire </em>supports <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-lets-switch-2-players-share-their-games-132431186.html\">GameShare</a>, so you only need one copy to play with up to three other people online (they'll each need a Switch 2) or locally (on separate Switch or Switch 2 systems). It supports <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/gamechat-is-decades-late-and-looks-pretty-janky-202309823.html\">GameChat</a> as well, so you can have you and your buddies' heads hanging out by the fire, where you can roast marshmallows, set off fireworks or carry out the time-honored tradition of telling spooky campfire stories (<em>Are You Afraid of the Dark?</em>-style) as your heads hover in the air.</p>\n<p>It all seems quite lovely, in truth. These days, I like the <em>idea </em>of camping more than actually camping. No, thank you. Too many bugs. So, <em>Chillin' by the Fire </em>seems right up my alley. It's out today on Nintendo Switch 2 and it costs $15.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/chillin-by-the-fire-is-a-relaxing-co-op-campfire-sim-thats-out-today-on-nintendo-switch-2-150009762.html?src=rss",

It's both one of the most confusing and influential entries in the long-running series, and the remake's updated visuals means it sits proudly alongside <em>Persona 5 Royal </em>as one of the most stylish RPGs you'll ever play. It's also one of the more repetitive entries, but that didn't put off the many Persona sickos out there from experiencing the remixed game all over again.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"95081f65429e4d65a04844b660cdcff9\"></div>\n<p>The Switch 2 version of <em>Persona 3 Reload </em>means the game will be playable on practically every modern platform, but the big question will be how it performs on the more powerful hardware.

It then divides lands and coastal waters into 10x10 meter squares, which it then analyzes and tracks over time. As <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/googles-newest-ai-model-acts-like-a-satellite-to-track-climate-change/\"><em>Wired</em></a> explains, these squares are color-coded to indicate different characteristics, such as vegetation types and material properties.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The company said AlphaEarth Foundations makes its data easy to use by creating what it calls &quot;highly compact summary&quot; for each square of land or coastal water it monitors. These compact summaries apparently need 16 times less storage compared to those produced by comparable AI systems, thereby reducing costs needed for Earth observation.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>So what exactly can the model's data be used for? Google explained that scientists can use the model to create detailed maps on demand for multiple purposes, such as to monitor crop health or to track deforestation. In its announcement, the company claimed that the model excelled at a wide range of tasks over different time periods when it was tested. &quot;AlphaEarth Foundations represents a significant step forward in understanding the state and dynamics of our changing planet,&quot; Google wrote. The company gave over 50 organizations access to the model's <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/GOOGLE_SATELLITE_EMBEDDING_V1_ANNUAL#description\">Satellite Embedding dataset</a>, a collection of its annual embeddings, to test its use in real world applications over the past year. Now, it has released the dataset in <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-earth-timelapse-3d-130027183.html\">Google Earth</a> Engine so that other scientists can use it for their own research.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-virtual-satellite-ai-model-can-provide-a-near-real-time-view-of-earth-133055880.html?src=rss",

            "summary": "<p><a href=\"https://brilliant.xyz/\">Brilliant Labs</a> is the startup behind Frame, the open-source smart glasses designed for hackers and other creative types. Today, the company is launching Halo, a new pair of glasses that, predictably for the age we live in, are being sold on the back of their AI features. Halo is a wayfarer-style pair (compared to the Panto-styled Frame) and, if you\u2019re a spectacles wearer, you\u2019ll be able to get prescription lenses in more than 100 countries thank to a partnership with SmartBuyGlasses.</p>\n<p>Brilliant is happy to brag that Halo includes a camera, microphone and bone-conduction speakers in its slender chassis. A natural pitfall of many smart glasses has been the compromises necessary to keep weight down while still offering enough functionality to be useful. Being able to keep the weight to a trim 40 grams is one hell of an achievement, especially given the glasses have a color OLED display and a battery that promises to run for 14 hours on a single charge.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Unfortunately, instead of a display that overlays onto the lens, Halo &quot;works&quot; by projecting into your peripheral vision. I\u2019ll be honest, these displays are becoming more of an irritation the more I use them, especially compared to models that have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/even-realities-g1-review-limited-but-effective-smart-glasses-140059586.html\">prisms inside the lenses</a>.</p>\n<p>Last year, Brilliant introduced Noa, its AI agent which it said was designed from the ground up to be used within the context of a pair of glasses. The company says that, when paired with Halo, Noa will be able to talk to you in a way that is natural and intuitive, as if \u201cspeaking with a real person.\u201d It claims the secret sauce is in the fact Noa will be able to \u201cunderstand what it hears and sees within its environment and responds with contextually relevant information in real time.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a lot of braggadocio, especially given the promises that come next about Narrative, its agentic memory system. Narrative will, so it is said, remember the name of a person you met or the details of a conversation you\u2019ve had \u201cyears or even decades later.\u201d This will harness the glasses\u2019 optical sensors and microphones to keep tabs on what\u2019s going on from your point of view. And since audio and video are both being constantly recorded, the system will build a \u201cprivate and personalized knowledge base\u201d about you.</p>\n<p>Naturally, a pair of AI-enabled smart glasses will raise privacy hackles, and Brilliant says Noa will act as a VPN between you and the AI model behind it. Your interactions will be private by default, and users will get a lot of fine-grain privacy controls to ensure they\u2019re happy with how much data they share. Plus, you\u2019ll have voice commands to turn off the microphone, camera and the glasses themselves should you need to. Although if you\u2019re doing something you\u2019d rather not be recorded, the smartest advice is to not wear a pair of AI glasses in the first place. Not to mention that your general concerns about having a database built of every single thing you do in a day (and your social graph) is likely to be easily de-anonymized if necessary.</p>\n<p>Brilliant also promises Halo will enable users to build custom applications for their glasses just from natural language commands. The company says that you just need to tell Noa what you need, and it\u2019ll build an app to serve your purpose \u201cwithin seconds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pre-orders for Halo are opening today, but shipping isn\u2019t due to begin until late November 2025, with the price set at $299. Compatible prescription lenses will be available to purchase through SmartBuyGlasses, too. The company is also taking great pains to tell users that it will, again, be releasing a limited number of pairs and so anyone interested in owning one will need to get in the line.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/brilliant-labs-launches-its-second-generation-smart-glasses-130000032.html?src=rss",

            "summary": "<p>A new cybersecurity &quot;breach&quot; has revealed the personal information of various celebrities, and while it won't let you steal their identities, it will allow you to... judge them. The &quot;<a href=\"https://panamaplaylists.com/\">Panama Playlists</a>&quot; details the Spotify song choices of notable people ranging from Vice President JD Vance to talk show host Seth Meyers to tech bros like Palmer Luckey. And technically, it wasn't a breach at all, but a possible lack of understanding around Spotify's privacy settings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spotify has always allowed users to make playlists public or private and some even actively seek followers. On top of that, each playlist cover shows &quot;Public Playlist&quot; or &quot;Private Playlist&quot; right up top. However, the default for new playlists is &quot;Public,&quot; so many users may not be aware that they're listening habits are available for the world to see \u2014 if someone looks hard enough.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>That's exactly what the unknown creator of the Panama Playlists did: simply search for famous people and find their public playlists. The results aren't really that interesting? Sure, it's kind of funny that JD Vance has <em>I Want It That Way</em> on his &quot;Making Dinner&quot; playlist, ironic that White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt's playlist features Aretha Franklin's <em>Respect</em>, and very on-the-nose that US AG Pam Bondi has <em>Cold As Ice</em> on her playlist.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Spotify's wonky privacy settings leaks celebrity songs in 'Panama Playlists'\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/668fc320-6df8-11f0-bfa5-089cbd0b0a6a\" style=\"height: 1228px; width: 1820px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Panama Playlists</div></figure>\n<p>Other standouts are <em>Young Dumb, Broke</em> by Khalid on Sam Bankman-Fried's &quot;loud&quot; playlist, James Blake's <em>Retrograde</em> on Pete Buttigieg's &quot;Election Eve&quot; playlist and <em>Billions and Billions</em> on venture capitalist Mark Andreesen's &quot;Focus Alpha&quot; list. In other words, everything is about as you'd expect given the personalities (most of whom aren't exactly in the A-list tier). As <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/privacy/716386/spotifys-terrible-privacy-settings-just-leaked-palmer-luckeys-bops-and-bangers\"><em>The Verge</em></a> noted, one list was attributed to Kara Swisher, but she said it was inaccurate so it was removed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While a relative trifle compared to other data leaks, Panama Playlists does show Spotify's loose behavior around user privacy. For one thing, it makes all your playlists public by default. If you switch that to private in the settings, it will only affect playlists created afterwards. You then need to set each one to private individually. Playlists, followers and following also appear on your profile by default. With that in mind, think of Spotify as not just a streaming but a social media platform, and treat your privacy accordingly.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/spotifys-lax-privacy-means-anyone-can-see-the-vice-presidents-song-choices-123015427.html?src=rss",

The company dug into its deep engineering toolkit in an effort to one-up the competition with features like a new sensor design, up to 8K 50 fps 10-bit log recording and a smaller, lighter body.</p> \n<p>It also matches or beats its rival in other areas, with similar battery life and superior low-light capability. After testing the device in various scenarios like riding around on an e-bike, I\u2019m impressed. Like other 360 cameras, though, the Osmo 360 sacrifices video quality for the convenience of unlimited angles. Plus, DJI\u2019s editing app still needs some work.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-design-and-features\">Design and features</h2> \n<p>Insta360\u2019s cameras made a splash in the action cam world because of a then-unique trait: they capture footage from all angles. That lets you reframe video in any direction so you\u2019re not stuck with a traditional camera's forward-only view. The downside is that quality is reduced from the stated resolution (from 8K to 4K, for example) when footage is \"de-warped\" or flattened to create the final video.</p> \n<p>DJI has so far stayed out of this category, but that's changed with the Osmo 360. Like rival models, it has a lens and sensor on each side, with a display at the back and a record and camera view button below (just like Insta360). There\u2019s also a power button on the side. Other settings and controls are operated from the screen or a smartphone via DJI's Mimo app.</p> \n<p>A key feature is the new 1-inch square sensor designed specifically for panoramic shooting. That allowed DJI to use 25 percent more of the sensor than rival models with rectangular chips, in turn boosting image quality and low-light capability. It also makes the camera more power-efficient.</p> \n<p>The Osmo 360 is a bit smaller than<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-x5-launch-date-price-hands-on-132439941.html\"> Insta360's latest model, the X5</a>. Though a bit thicker and wider, the Osmo is substantially shorter at just 83mm compared to the X5 (124.5mm). It's also about 9 percent lighter at 183 grams. All that makes it slightly easier to carry and attach to your body, bikes or other things, though it's still bulkier than a regular action cam.</p> \n<p>Another bonus with the Osmo 360 is the 105GB of usable built-in storage (plus a microSD slot), compared to\u2026 zero for the competition. The battery is the same as the one in the Osmo Action 4 Pro and 5 Pro, so owners of those models already have a compatible battery. It supports up to 120 minutes of 8K 30 fps recording in endurance mode, or 100 minutes in regular mode, similar to the X5's 93/115 minutes. On top of that, battery life on the Osmo 360 can be boosted to 180 minutes with an optional battery extension rod.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-video-and-audio\">Video and audio</h2> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"DJI's Osmo 360 action camera takes on Insta360 with a newly designed sensor\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/a77df2d0-6d17-11f0-bbff-052341116f7c\" style=\"height: 1667px; width: 2500px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  DJI\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>With its new sensor, the Osmo 360 can produce the highest quality video in the 360 category at up to 8K 50 fps, compared to 8K 30 fps on the Insta360 X5 and 6K 30 fps on the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/insta360-one-rs-modular-action-cam-360-leica-130406120.html\">Insta360 One RS</a>. That in turn lets creators capture high-quality flat (de-warped) video at up to 4K 50 fps. The new model also offers 10-bit D-LogM recording to boost dynamic range, which is better than the X5's 8-bit I-Log. And if you'd rather record flat video, you can do that in single-lens \"Boost Video\" mode at 4K 120 fps, with a field of view up to 170 degrees.</p> \n<p>What's more, I was able to continuously capture 8K at 50 fps for nearly 90 minutes (8K at 30 fps for just over 100 minutes) without any overheating or other issues. That's impressive considering the size of the camera and amount of data being pushed through it.</p> \n<p>The other benefit is improved low-light capability in all modes. DJI says that the native 8K pixel size is 2.4 micrometers, twice that of the X5, allowing for increased light gathering. If you want to take panoramic photos, the Osmo 360 beats the competition there as well with up to 120MP photos (compared to 72MP for the X5), or it can bin four pixels down to one for 30MP photos with lower noise in low light.</p> \n<p>After testing it in day and night conditions, I\u2019m impressed. In good light, it was on par with Insta360's X5 in terms of sharpness and color accuracy. It was superior in tricky contrasty situations, though, with the D-LogM profile boosting dynamic range. Skies, shiny roads and other brightly lit objects showed more detail than the 8-bit I-log video shot with the X5 and shadows were also less washed out.</p> \n<div id=\"f19e92c396f3427bac7a3fc4b55705cf\">\n \n</div> \n<p>DJI's digital RockSteady stabilization delivered impressively smooth video, even over rough cobblestone roads. And as with other DJI devices, you can let the camera bank with your movements or keep the horizon level (HorizonSteady), although that will come at the cost of some resolution. Stitching was also seamless (except occasionally with objects close to the camera), so I could choose any angle without worrying about distortion.</p> \n<p>Not all was perfect though. As with other 360 models, the Osmo 360 is clearly less sharp than DJI's Action 5 Pro after conversion to 4K flat video. And while low-light performance was indeed very good, digital stabilization became problematic when shooting at night, showing signs of pixelation and video tearing due to motion blur. However, that\u2019s a problem that\u2019s typical with all action cams since they lack optical stabilization.</p> \n<p>Like other DJI Action cams, the Osmo 360 supports the company's Mic 2 and Mic Mini wireless microphones and can record from two of those at the same time via its OsmoAudio direct connection system. You can also connect third-party wireless earbuds as I did with Samsung's Galaxy Buds Pro 2, though only one set at a time.</p> \n<p>DJI\u2019s mics allow for crisp and clear audio, and add a lot of convenience. When paired with the camera, they can also record audio internally to provide a backup copy. Insta360 recently released its own microphone system with the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9df9a494-851b-48b6-9e57-082aadf91d3a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=%2450+Mic+Air&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmluc3RhMzYwLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0L21pYy1haXIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjlkZjlhNDk0LTg1MWItNDhiNi05ZTU3LTA4MmFhZGY5MWQzYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yZS5pbnN0YTM2MC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdC9taWMtYWlyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbbWiGKRbLj7W69MeSu-JlaKqg2Al1B4Hng3GcI6E_rw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.insta360.com%2Fproduct%2Fmic-air\">$50 Mic Air</a> that connects directly to the Insta360 X5 and Insta360 Ace Pro 2. However, those models can only use one mic at a time rather than two like the Osmo 360.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-dji-studio-editing\">DJI Studio editing</h2> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"DJI's Studio editing app still needs some work next to the competition.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/a4ed4d40-6e11-11f0-9dff-2f05982d9f0c\" style=\"height: 2160px; width: 3840px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>Software is an important component of panoramic cameras. On top of editing, they help creators change camera angles and do 360-specific moves. And if you plan to output full panoramic content, it injects that metadata into the final video so that apps like Facebook and YouTube will recognize it correctly.</p> \n<p>A big reason for Insta360\u2019s success has been its excellent Studio app that helps users do all of those things. DJI\u2019s response to that is a new app of its own, which is also called Studio, but its first crack at a 360 editor doesn\u2019t quite measure up to its rival.</p> \n<p>DJI Studio does let you do basic editing, like inserting shots and trimming them. However, it\u2019s not the most intuitive process \u2014 it took me too long to figure out how to trim shots before inserting them into the timeline. It\u2019s also a bit buggy: the source display tends to show shots you haven\u2019t selected and the camera angles sometimes randomly change. It also lacks features found on Insta360 Studio like text overlays and transitions.</p> \n<p>That said, DJI Studio does a good job with its most important task. It\u2019s easy to switch to a new view using keyframes and set animations to improve smoothness. You can then export video in either flat or panoramic formats and import it into apps like Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve for the final color correction, effects and titles. All told, DJI Studio is good for a first release, but still needs work compared to its main rival.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wrap-up\">Wrap-up</h2> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"DJI's Osmo 360 action camera takes on Insta360 with a novel square sensor\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/f79634d0-6d21-11f0-bdb3-eeec46244e87\" style=\"height: 1667px; width: 2500px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>It took DJI awhile to get a panoramic action cam into the market, but the Osmo 360 was worth the wait. It stacks up well against its main rival, Insta360\u2019s X5, by offering better video quality in low light or high-contrast situations. It\u2019s also easy to use, offers good battery life and trumps its competition with a large amount of built-in storage.</p> \n<p>The primary drawbacks are slightly lower image quality compared to regular action cams and stabilization that breaks down a bit in low light. The all-new DJI Studio app also needs some work. For a first effort, though, the Osmo 360 is a surprisingly solid rival to Insta360\u2019s X5.</p> \n<p>DJI's Osmo 360 is now available nearly everywhere but the US at \u20ac480 for the Standard Combo (around $554) which includes a single battery, protective pouch and rubber lens protector, or \u20ac630 ($728) for the Adventure Combo which adds two extra batteries, a charger, a quick release adapter mount and a 1.2m Invisible Selfie Stick. As for US availability, \"it will not be available for sale immediately in the U.S. market through official DJI channels,\" a DJI spokesperson told Engadget. \"We currently do not have an estimated timeline\u2026 but we will let you know when we do.\"</p> \n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-osmo-360-review-a-capable-action-cam-thats-a-real-threat-to-insta360-120019592.html?src=rss",

Whether its your phone, wireless earbuds, smartwatch or all three of those things, you can power them up cord-free using a good<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html\"> wireless charger</a>. And if you do plan to rely on wireless power-ups for your most-used devices, a multi-device wireless charger is a good investment. These accessories neatly charge up more than one device simultaneously, without using a bunch of cables that can mess up your space. We've tested a bunch of the latest multi-device wireless chargers; you\u2019ll find out top picks below for the best wireless charging pads, plus some advice on how to choose the right one for your needs.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-best-wireless-charging-pads\">Best wireless charging pads</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-do-wireless-charging-pads-work-with-any-phone-or-device\">Do wireless charging pads work with any phone or device?</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-how-to-pick-the-best-wireless-charging-pad-for-your-needs\">How to pick the best wireless charging pad for your needs</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-wireless-charging-speed-and-performance\">Wireless charging speed and performance</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-wireless-charging-pads\">Best wireless charging pads</h2> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-do-wireless-charging-pads-work-with-any-phone-or-device\">Do wireless charging pads work with any phone or device?</h2> \n<p>The short answer is no, but the long and more detailed answer starts with it depends. Regular old wireless charging pucks should work with any device that\u2019s compatible with the same wireless charging standard that the charger supports. Smartphones and other mobile devices that support wireless charging nowadays are likely to support the Qi standard, so double check that your phone or gadget fits that bill and it should work with any Qi wireless charging pad (all of our top picks fall into this category).</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>When it comes to multi-device chargers, things can get a little tricky. Rather than starting your search looking for the most universally adaptable accessory, consider the devices you have and aspire to own in the future. If you\u2019re an iPhone user with an Apple Watch, you may want to look for a wireless charger that has a Watch pad built in. Ditto if you\u2019re a Samsung phone owner and use a Galaxy Watch. Some earbuds support wireless charging, but you\u2019ll only need an open pad or space on your multi-device charger where you can sit the earbuds in their case down for a power-up.</p> \n<p>Those with iPhone 12s and newer Apple smartphones can take advantage of MagSafe chargers, which magnetically attach to their handsets. Android devices don\u2019t support Apple\u2019s proprietary MagSafe technology, but you can buy a <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B09BZ17JM7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=92afccad-7a6d-4b3e-b701-91c6301fd52f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=magnetic+adapter+for+pretty+cheap&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAdEX_d0-vXtE7h5w9QtUo9s6V3nZnhWggLO4XCvtu56x&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FESR-HaloLock-Universal-Conversion-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB09BZ17JM7%2F\">magnetic adapter for pretty cheap</a> that will allow your Samsung or Pixel phone to work with MagSafe multi-device chargers.

It might sit on your nightstand or on your desk. Not everyone buys a charger just for themselves, though; you might want to use one as a shared station for you and a partner.</p> \n<p>If the charger will sit on your nightstand, you\u2019ll likely want a compact, stable unit that won\u2019t swallow all your free space or tumble to the floor (and if it does fall, one with enough durability to survive). Some may prefer a lay-flat design if your phone screen has a tendency to keep you awake at night. Others might use their phone as their alarm clock, in which case you may want a stand that keeps the screen within reach and eyeshot. This is also the preferred design if you use Standby Mode on iPhones.</p> \n<p>A vertical orientation may be best for a charger that lives on your desk so you can more easily check notifications throughout the day. Will the charger sit on a low table? Horizontal charger pads may make it easier to grab your devices in a hurry. Travel chargers should fold up or otherwise protect the pads while they\u2019re in your bag. And, yes, aesthetics count. You may want something pretty if it\u2019s likely to sit in a posh room where guests will see it.</p> \n<p>For vehicles, consider a wireless car charger if you frequently need to top off your device on the go. These chargers combine convenience with functionality, ensuring your phone stays powered while you\u2019re navigating and taking calls at the same time. We also heavily recommend a magnetic charger so there\u2019s less of a chance your phone will go flying into the passenger\u2019s seat the next time you hit a pothole.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wireless-charging-speed-and-performance\">Wireless charging speed and performance</h2> \n<p>It\u2019s no secret that wireless charging is slower than wired, and powering multiple devices adds a new wrinkle. As these chargers often have to support a wide range of hardware, you\u2019ll have to forget about the fastest, device-specific options from brands like Google, OnePlus and Samsung.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s not to say these will be slow, but there just isn\u2019t much separating them on the charging speed front. As a general rule, the quickest multi-device chargers tend to top out at 15W for phones. It\u2019s rare that you\u2019ll find a truly slow-as-molasses example, mind you. Even some of the most affordable options we\u2019ve seen will recharge your phone at a reasonable 7.5W or 10W, and the 5W for other devices like wireless earbuds is more than enough.</p> \n<p>If you\u2019re only docking overnight or while you work, speed won\u2019t make a huge difference. Just be sure that whatever you buy is powerful enough for a phone in a case. Some chargers may also include an AC adapter in the box. If not, make sure you\u2019re using one with the right power level to get the fastest charge.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html?src=rss",

            "summary": "<p>Whether you're listening to playlists on your daily commute or zoning out with a podcast at home, wireless headphones can make your audio experience much more comfortable. With no cords to untangle or get caught on your bag, they\u2019re a great pick for anyone who wants convenience without compromising on sound quality. If comfort and immersive audio are high on your priority list, over-ear wireless headphones are often the way to go \u2014 they wrap around your ears to help block out the world and deliver rich detailed sound that earbuds can sometimes miss.<br /><br />There\u2019s a wide range of over-ear wireless headphones to choose from, whether you want active noise cancellation, long battery life or a comfy fit for marathon listening sessions. Of course, if you're after something a little more compact or tailored to a specific use case, we also have you covered with our buying guides for the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html\">best earbuds</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-gaming-headset-130006477.html\">best gaming headsets</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-budget-wireless-earbuds-130028735.html\">best budget earbuds</a>. But if wireless headphones with top-tier sound and a comfortable, over-ear design are what you're after, read on \u2014 we\u2019ve tested the top options to help you find the right pair.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-best-wireless-headphones-for-2025\">Best wireless headphones for 2025</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-how-to-choose-the-best-wireless-headphones-for-you\">How to choose the best wireless headphones for you</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-how-we-test-over-ear-headphones\">How we test over-ear headphones</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-other-wireless-headphones-we-tested\">Other wireless headphones we tested</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-wireless-headphones-faqs\">Wireless headphones FAQs</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-wireless-headphones-for-2025\">Best wireless headphones for 2025</h2> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-choose-the-best-wireless-headphones-for-you\">How to choose the best wireless headphones for you</h2> \n<p>When it comes to shopping for a good pair of wireless headphones, the first thing you\u2019ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of our buyer\u2019s guide, we focus on the over-ear style as that\u2019s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear designs are much more effective at blocking sound. Speaking of noise cancellation, you\u2019ll want to determine early on if you even want that. If you frequently crank up the beats in noisy environments, you\u2019ll want to not only make sure it\u2019s there, but also make sure it\u2019s good, preferably with adaptive ANC. If you plan to use your new headphones in quieter spaces, skipping ANC can save you some money.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>The next area to consider is features. We recommend trying to get the most bang for your buck, but as you\u2019re shopping around you should determine which items are must-haves and what you can live without. And don\u2019t take basic things like automatic pausing and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-bluetooth-tracker-140028377.html\">Bluetooth</a> multipoint connectivity for granted, as not all companies include them. We also suggest reading reviews to see how well a company\u2019s more advanced features work. This will help you decide if those are something you\u2019re willing to (likely) pay extra for. Keep an eye on better battery life estimates to avoid disappointment, as some manufacturers promise more hours than real-world testing delivers. And don\u2019t be easily swayed by lofty promises about call quality without verifying them.</p> \n<p>Sound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. We understand this isn\u2019t easy at a time when we\u2019re doing most of our shopping online. But trying on a set of headphones and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer\u2019s remorse. We also recommend paying attention to things like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-era-300-review-a-big-bet-on-spatial-audio-130053487.html\">Spatial Audio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/dolby-atmos-will-use-your-tv-to-expand-living-room-speaker-setups-123021095.html\">Dolby Atmos</a>, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all headphones support them, so you\u2019ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you. If you plan to use your headphones for other media besides music, checking for latency is also a must \u2014 some delay can impact playback for things like movies or games, even if most true wireless headphones now offer minimal lag.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-over-ear-headphones\">How we test over-ear headphones</h2> \n<p>The primary way we test wireless headphones is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don\u2019t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/\">podcasts</a>, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, we\u2019ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps us from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.</p> \n<p>To judge the best Bluetooth headphones, we focus on higher-quality audio by listening to a variety of genres and paying close attention to how each style sounds. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess the quality of phone calls, we\u2019ll record audio samples with the headphones\u2019 microphones as well as have third parties call us.</p> \n<p>When it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones we\u2019re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we\u2019ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that we review.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-wireless-headphones-we-tested\">Other wireless headphones we tested</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-airpods-max\">AirPods Max</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html\">Apple\u2019s AirPods Max</a> are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancelation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-dyson-on-trac\">Dyson On-Trac</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/dyson-ontrac-headphones-review-when-the-basics-arent-enough-151518312.html\">On-Trac headphones</a> have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that\u2019s what\u2019s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren\u2019t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor which is actually handy. All told, that\u2019s not a lot in a set of $500 headphones.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sonos-ace\">Sonos Ace</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-ace-headphones-review-an-impressive-but-incomplete-debut-130040041.html\">Sonos Ace</a> is an excellent debut for the company\u2019s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sony-ult-wear\">Sony ULT Wear</h3> \n<p>If most headphones don\u2019t have the level of bass you desire, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-ult-wear-headphones-review-brain-shaking-bass-160000739.html\">ULT Wear</a> is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn\u2019t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sony-wh-ch720n\">Sony WH-CH720N</h3> \n<p>While the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-ch720n-review-160032871.html\">WH-CH720N</a> are a great affordable option, we prefer the Audio-Technica in the budget category. Sony\u2019s cans are lightweight with good sound quality, but ANC struggles at times and they\u2019re made with a lot of plastic.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-beats-studio-pro\">Beats Studio Pro</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-pro-review-upgraded-sound-makes-all-the-difference-140058369.html\">Studio Pro</a> lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they\u2019re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones\">Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-review-a-new-spin-on-a-reliable-formula-160009025.html\">Bose\u2019s latest flagship model</a> has a lot to offer, but its trademark Immersive Audio feature can be inconsistent across different types of music. There\u2019s still world-class ANC, excellent comfort and a clearer transparency mode, but for the price, the non-Ultra model is a better choice right now.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-master--dynamic-mh40-2nd-gen\">Master &amp; Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen)</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mh40-wireless-2nd-gen-review-133022239.html\">MH40</a> are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn\u2019t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company\u2019s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-bowers--wilkins-px8\">Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px8</h3> \n<p>The company\u2019s trademark pristine sound is on display <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px8-review-183002357.html\">here</a>, but the Px8 are more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S2.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wireless-headphones-faqs\">Wireless headphones FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-can-you-tell-the-quality-of-wireless-headphones\">How can you tell the quality of wireless headphones?</h3> \n<p>I typically look at three factors: design, sound quality and features. In terms of design, I\u2019m usually looking to see if the build quality of the headphones feels cheap and plasticky. Plenty of companies use plastic, but they can do so in a way that doesn\u2019t look or feel like budget models. For sound quality, I want to hear a nice, even tuning where highs, mids and lows are all well represented. No overly boomy bass or scooped out mids. I also want good clarity where you can pick up fine details and an open, immersive soundstage. Features is typically a distant third, but if a company doesn\u2019t cover basic functionality (automatic pausing, transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth, etc.) it can be an indication of overall quality.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-i-choose-the-best-quality-wireless-headphones\">How do I choose the best quality wireless headphones?</h3> \n<p>\u201cBest\u201d can be pretty subjective, but I always recommend going to a place where you can listen to the headphones you\u2019re thinking about buying before you commit. Sometimes this isn\u2019t possible, so you\u2019ll want to check return policies. I also recommend doing some research to determine what your priorities are in a new set. Are you an audiophile who wants the best sound quality? Is powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) the most important? Would you rather have conveniences like automatic pausing?</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-which-brand-has-the-best-wireless-headphones\">Which brand has the best wireless headphones?</h3> \n<p>Sony consistently tops our list with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478.html\">its 1000X line</a>. This is mostly due to the combination of sound quality, ANC performance and the truckload of features these headphones pack in. I\u2019ll be the first to tell you that there are better sounding options and other companies, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-45-review-143031637.html\">like Bose</a>, offer more effective noise cancellation. But when you add everything up, no one comes close to the full slate of tools Sony puts in its premium headphone line.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-do-expensive-wireless-headphones-sound-better\">Do expensive wireless headphones sound better?</h3> \n<p>Exorbitant price tags don\u2019t mean better audio quality. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px8-review-183002357.html\">Bowers &amp; Wilkins\u2019</a> <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px7-s2-review-170001854.html\">headphones</a> are on the high end for wireless noise-canceling models and they sound amazing. However, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio-technica-ath-m50xbt2-wireless-headphones-155041750.html\">Audio-Technica\u2019s M50xBT2</a> is much more affordable and doesn\u2019t have ANC, but these headphones have a warm, natural sound profile that I find very inviting. At the end of the day, it will come down to personal preference, but you don\u2019t need to spend a lot to find great headphones.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html?src=rss",

            "summary": "<p>Earlier today, Mark Zuckerberg shared a rambling <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/mark-zuckerberg-shares-a-confusing-vision-for-ai-superintelligence-153944322.html\"><ins>memo</ins></a> outlining his vision to build AI &quot;superintelligence.&quot; In the memo, Zuckerberg hinted that the pursuit of more powerful AI might require the company to be more selective in what it open sources.</p>\n<p>Citing &quot;safety concerns&quot; he wrote that Meta would need to be &quot;rigorous&quot; about such decisions. The line stood out to many as Zuckerberg \u2014 who once said &quot;<a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mark-zuckerberg-says-fck-that-to-closed-platforms-235700788.html\"><ins>fuck that</ins></a>&quot; in reference to closed platforms \u2014 has made open source central to Meta's AI strategy.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>During Meta's second quarter earnings call, Zuckerberg further acknowledged there could be a shift, though he downplayed the significance of it. Here's what he said when asked if his thinking had changed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I don't think that our thinking has particularly changed on this. We've always open sourced some of our models and not open sourced everything that we've done. So I would expect that we will continue to produce and share leading open source models. I also think that there are a couple of trends that are playing out. One is that we're getting models that are so big that they're just not practical for a lot of other people to use, so we kind of wrestle with whether it's productive or helpful to share that, or if that's really just primarily helping competitors or something like that. So I think that there's, there's that concern. <br /><br />And then obviously, as you approach real superintelligence, I think there's a whole different set of safety concerns that I think we need to take very seriously, that I wrote about in my note this morning. But I think the bottom line is I would expect that we will continue open sourcing work. I expect us to continue to be a leader there, and I also expect us to continue to not open source everything that we do, which is a continuation of kind of what we, what we've been, been kind of working on.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That's notably different than what he wrote almost exactly a year ago in a <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/\"><ins>different memo</ins></a> titled &quot;Open Source AI is the Path Forward.&quot; In that, even longer note, he said that open source is crucial for both Meta and developers.</p>\n<p>&quot;People often ask if I\u2019m worried about giving up a technical advantage by open sourcing Llama, but I think this misses the big picture,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I expect AI development will continue to be very competitive, which means that open sourcing any given model isn\u2019t giving away a massive advantage over the next best models at that point in time.&quot;</p>\n<p>He also argued that open source is <em>safer</em>. &quot;There is an ongoing debate about the safety of open source AI models, and my view is that open source AI will be safer than the alternatives. As long as everyone has access to similar generations of models \u2013 which open source promotes \u2013 then governments and institutions with more compute resources will be able to check bad actors with less compute.&quot;</p>\n<p>To be clear, Zuckerberg said the company would continue to open source some of its work. But he seems to be laying the groundwork for a future in which Meta's &quot;superintelligence&quot; could be a lot less open.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/is-mark-zuckerberg-flip-flopping-on-open-source-ai-231310567.html?src=rss",

In addition to the limits on some explicit content, Spotify may use the results of these checks to deactivate an account if the user is below the minimum required age to be on the platform. In the UK, the minimum age for Spotify users is 13. &quot;If you cannot confirm you\u2019re old enough to use Spotify, your account will be deactivated and eventually deleted,&quot; the company said.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The UK's Online Safety Act has seen companies and services including <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-begins-age-verification-checks-for-uk-users-134516723.html\"><ins>Reddit</ins></a>, <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/bluesky-is-adding-age-verification-features-for-users-in-the-uk-195753332.html\"><ins>Bluesky</ins></a>, <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/microsoft-plans-to-bring-xbox-age-verification-to-countries-outside-of-the-uk-201953614.html\"><ins>Microsoft/Xbox</ins></a> and <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/people-in-the-uk-now-have-to-take-an-age-verification-selfie-to-watch-porn-online-164418948.html\"><ins>pornography providers</ins></a> now requiring some form of age verification, either within the region or for all users.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/spotify-now-requires-face-scans-to-access-age-restricted-content-in-the-uk-210738192.html?src=rss",

            "summary": "<p>Fable, a startup designing tools to generate animated TV shows from scratch, is launching an AI-powered streaming service this week, <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/netflix-of-ai-amazon-invests-fable-showrunner-launch-1236471989/\"><em>Variety </em>reports</a>. The service is called Showrunner, and it will allow subscribers to generate scenes, view content created for Fable's in-house AI-generated animated shows and even insert themselves into the animations they generate.</p>\n<p>Showrunner is launching in alpha, and <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.showrunner.xyz/\">based on Fable's website</a>, you'll primarily interact with it through the company's Discord to start. Per <em>Variety, </em>subscribers will pay anywhere from $10 to $20 month for credits that can be exchanged for the ability to generate new animated scenes. The word &quot;scenes&quot; is key here. While Fable is launching with a couple of distinct animated shows, they're really more like collections of worlds and characters that subscribers can use to create new scenes.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Those include <em>Exit Valley</em>, a <em>Family Guy</em>-inspired riff on the culture of Silicon Valley, and <em>Everything is Fine, </em>a comedy about a husband and wife who are stranded in an alternate world and trying to reunite. The company's goal is bigger than than just original content. Fable founder Edward Saatchi<em>&nbsp;</em>imagines a Disney-owned &quot;Toy Story of AI&quot; where subscribers could generate endless new scenes of Buzz and Woody interacting. For now, though, interested Showrunner users have to settle with knockoffs.</p>\n<p>Engadget was able to preview an earlier version of Fable's Showrunner AI models back in 2019 that capably <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-simulation-ai-put-me-in-a-south-park-episode-170002565.html\">generated new <em>South Park</em> episodes</a> based on audio inputs. The startup's model was able to create a watchable copy of the show's style even back then, which might be why Amazon has invested an undisclosed amount in Fable as part of the launch of Showrunner.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While creatives remain skeptical to downright antagonist towards AI, companies have started using it more publicly in production. For example, <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-is-already-using-generative-ai-in-its-original-shows-201209502.html\">Netflix recently touted</a> its use of generative AI in its original show <em>The Eternaut</em>. Even if adoption grows, though, that doesn't really clarify whether the average film or TV viewer has any desire to generate content on their own, especially if it's as rough-around-the-edges<em>&nbsp;</em>as most AI-generated media is. Besides being a public demonstration of Fable's tech, Showrunner seems like a test to see if that desire is even there.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/showrunner-an-ai-powered-streaming-service-launches-in-alpha-this-week-204042241.html?src=rss",

The specific duty will only be a available for six months, after which all shipments will be subject to an ad valorem duty.

Well, white supremacist content led to another headache for the company this week. <em>User Mag</em> reported on Tuesday that the app <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.usermag.co/p/substack-sent-a-push-alert-promoting-nazi-white-supremacist-blog\">sent a push alert</a> to some users promoting a Nazi newsletter. The company told Engadget the notification was an \"extremely offensive and disturbing\" error.</p>\n<p>The Substack newsletter in question describes itself as \"a National Socialist weekly newsletter.\" It includes \"opinions and news important to the National Socialist and White Nationalist Community.\" The far-right blog has a mere 757 subscribers. (That's a drop in the ocean compared to, say, Heather Cox Richardson's 2.6 million, George Saunders' 312,000 and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 236,000.)</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Given the newsletter's offensive content and relatively paltry audience, this wouldn't seem like something to promote. According to the company, it didn't mean to. \"We discovered an error that caused some people to receive push notifications they should never have received,\" a Substack spokesperson told Engadget.</p>\n<p>\"In some cases, these notifications were extremely offensive or disturbing,\" the statement continued. \"This was a serious error, and we apologize for the distress it caused. We have taken the relevant system offline, diagnosed the issue and are making changes to ensure it doesn't happen again.\"</p>\n<p>Engadget asked Substack for extra details or context about how the accident happened. It didn't have further comment at the time of publication. We'll update this story if we find out more.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Screenshot of a Substack Nazi newsletter.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/b11b2190-6d72-11f0-bd9f-237b6fb91d66\" style=\"height: 814px; width: 1447px;\" /><figcaption>The newsletter in question</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Substack</div></figure>\n<p><em>User Mag</em> <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.usermag.co/p/substack-sent-a-push-alert-promoting-nazi-white-supremacist-blog\">reports</a> that those who clicked on the Nazi blog's profile received recommendations for a similar one. That one had a larger audience of 8,600 subscribers.</p>\n<p>One reason social users were quick to pounce on the latest incident: It provides a symbolic callback to Substack's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/substack-removes-five-pro-nazi-newsletters-but-says-its-rules-arent-changing-005815459.html?guccounter=1\">2023 Nazi shitstorm</a>. That's when <em>The Atlantic</em> <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/11/substack-extremism-nazi-white-supremacy-newsletters/676156/\">dug up</a> \"scores\" of white-supremacist, neo-Confederate and Nazi newsletters on the platform. Some were monetized.</p>\n<p>Substack's policy is one of anti-censorship. \"I just want to make it clear that we don't like Nazis either \u2014 we wish no one held those views,\" Substack cofounder Hamish McKenzie <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://substack.com/@hamish/note/c-45811343\">wrote</a> in December 2023. \"But some people do hold those and other extreme views. Given that, we don't think that censorship (including through demonetizing publications) makes the problem go away \u2014 in fact, it makes it worse.\"</p>\n<p>After weeks of negative press coverage and prominent authors leaving the platform, Substack relented\u2026 sort of. On one hand, the company removed \"some\" pro-Nazi publications. However, it did so without changing its policies. Instead, it said five publications violated its existing content guidelines. Specifically, they broke rules prohibiting \"incitements to violence based on protected classes.\"</p>\n<p>Some critics didn't believe that was enough. <em>The Platformer</em>'s Casey Newton, a prominent voice who left Substack during the episode, thought the company needed to take more responsibility. \"Every platform hosts its share of racists, white nationalists and other noxious personalities,\" Newton <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.platformer.news/why-substack-is-at-a-crossroads/\">wrote</a> in early 2024. \"In some very real sense, there is no escaping them online. But there ought to be ways to see them less; to recommend them less; to fund them less. Other platforms have realized this as they\u2019ve grown up. Here\u2019s hoping Substack does the same.\"</p>\n<p>Substack has since found its footing as a haven for independent content creators. Numerous journalists looking to build an audience sans traditional media have flocked to it. (Among others, that list includes <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/business/media/tina-brown-substack.html\">Tina Brown</a>, <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/jim-acosta-heads-substack-cnn-215712618.html\">Jim Acosta</a>, <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/06/12/terry-moran-trump-substack-abc-news-trump-miller\">Terry Moran</a> and <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/13/media/jennifer-rubin-norm-eisen-contrarian-washington-post\">Jennifer Rubin</a>.)
